As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.</p><p>The medical condition — which usually occurs after a stroke or a head injury — can impact a person’s ability to speak, write and understand verbal and written language, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Mayo Clinic</a>.</p><p>The star had struggled with “cognitive issues” while filming recent movies, could not remember his lines and used an earpiece, <a href=#>a source told Page Six.</a></p><p>“It was increasingly difficult to have him on screen,” the source said of a 2020 film. “So they’d use body doubles, not just for action [sequences], but for maximizing his screen time.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">“We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,” Rumer Willis announced on social media. <span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Rumer Willis, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Scout Willis, Emma Heming Willis and Tallulah Willis attend Demi Moore’s “Inside Out” book party on September 23, 2019. <span class=credit>Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for goop</span></figure><p>“Everybody knew, the cast and crew. His family has stepped in, they moved in to take care of him,” the source said. “They all knew Bruce was having problems.”</p><p>His time on camera was “whittled down” to just three days because of cognitive issues during one project, the source said. “He could not act anymore.”</p><p>Willis’ family did not say what caused the disorder in the actor’s case.</p><p>But the actor was hit in the head on the set of the action flick “Tears of the Sun” in 2002 and later sued Revolution Studios over the injury, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Guardian reported at the time.</a></p><p>In the lawsuit, Willis claimed he suffered “extreme mental, physical and emotional pain” when he was struck on the forehead by a “projectile” during the detonation of pyrotechnics by the movie’s special effects unit.</p><p>The accident reportedly required physicians and medical staff to treat him.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis in “The Sixth Sense.” <span class=credit>Ron Phillips/Spyglass Enterainment/AP</span></figure><p>Aphasia sometimes causes people to struggle to find the right words or to speak in short jumbled sentences. It can be treated to some extent with speech and language therapy.</p><p>Last year, Willis was given his own <a href=#>special category for the Razzies</a> — parody awards for the year’s worst movies” — after he starred in eight critically panned films in 2021.</p><p>Willis, whose career has spanned 40 years, has also appeared in blockbuster films such as “Pulp Fiction,” “12 Monkeys” and “The Fifth Element.”</p><p>He currently has several movies in post-production , including “Vendetta,” “Fortress: Sniper’s Eye” and “White Elephant.”</p><p>One of his final roles was that of Ryan Swan — a man seeking vengeance on the kingpin who murdered his father — in the action movie “Paradise City,” which was shot with John Travolta in Maui, Hawaii last year.</p><p>A rep for Willis did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xmbGhfl7%2B2r8RmrqKknJ7Abr%2FTnqepoZ6ceqLDwLJkn6qfonqir9OipaBllKqybsDOZpipoJGotqJ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./father-daughter-rap-354334.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./father-daughter-rap-354334.html>Father Raps To His Daughter For 'Woman Crush Wednesday'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alma-julia-hightower.html>Alma Julia Hightower</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alma-julia-hightower.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
