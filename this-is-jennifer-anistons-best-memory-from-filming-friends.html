When she thinks about filming Friends for 10 seasons, Jennifer Aniston has one memory that she really cherishes. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=the-best-memory>The Best Memory</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston has become a massive movie star who is in the news all the time, most recently for her comments about <a href=#>friends who won't get the COVID-19 vaccine</a>.</p><p>Of course, Jennifer Aniston is often interviewed about Friends, and fans are always thrilled to hear what she has to say.</p><p>What is one of her best memories of the sitcom? Jennifer Aniston has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fond memories of the first table read</a>.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Aniston and Lisa Kudrow were interviewed for the Actors On Actors issue put out by Variety, and it was really sweet to hear them discuss the popular sitcom. Aniston said, “You were wearing an appropriate Phoebe Buffay [outfit] — like, a white linen, hippie shirt, and you had a bunch of seashells and necklaces on. And you had your hair pulled up in two little clips, and you had these little blond tendrils. So, so, so beautiful! And Courteney [Cox] had on a pink baby tee with a white trim.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is really fun for fans to hear about, especially since Kudrow and Cox were wearing outfits that sound very '90s and retro now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Bruce Willis Appeared On ‘Friends’</a></span></p><h2 id=starring-on-39-friends-39>Starring On 'Friends'</h2><p>In 2019, Aniston appeared at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's Patron of the Artists Awards, and Cox and Kudrow talked about how they have been super close friends. Aniston won an Artist Inspiration award for her charity work. In her speech, Aniston talked about what playing Rachel has meant to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston said, "Friends was lightening in a bottle. Yes it was. And I mean, I don't mean the ratings. I mean, it was a very rarity environment where there was truly no competition amongst each other, no egos. Um, we were just six relatively unknown actors learning on the job together and thanking our lucky stars for being part of this rocket ship on a show. And we didn't care who got the best line. Although Matt[hew] Perry usually did steal all of the good lines, but it didn't matter."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston was interviewed by Collider</a> and explained that when she was hired to play Rachel, the show went by the name Friends Like Us. She said that she was on a TV show that probably wasn't going to get picked up, and that's when she had her audition for Rachel. Aniston said, "I went on auditions for second position, as they call it. I read the script, and I had never had a reaction like that to a show. It was my contemporaries, it was in New York City, it was funny, it was interesting, and I had never read anything like it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explained that the TV show she was on did get picked up, but of course, she ended up playing Rachel, and the rest is history. Aniston said "I had 10 years of the best schooling in the world," which is sweet to hear about, since fans feel that she was totally made to play this character.</p><p>It's incredible to think that if Jennifer Aniston had stayed on the other sitcom, who would have played Rachel, and what Friends would have looked like.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Did Jennifer Aniston Go Braless As Rachel On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><h2 id=favorite-39-friends-39-episode>Favorite 'Friends' Episode</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every fan has their own Friends episode that means the most or just makes them laugh hysterically every time they even think about it. These are so personal, although there are definitely episodes that everyone enjoys. It's fun to learn what Jennifer Aniston's favorite episode is.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A 'Friends' And 'Seinfeld' Crossover Nearly Happened</a></span></p><p>According to Us Weekly, Jennifer Aniston has talked about an episode that she finds enjoyable: season 2's "The One With The Prom Video." She liked seeing flashbacks of Monica in high school, and she also mentioned Ross's hairstyle and Rachel before she got a nose job.</p><p>In 2020, Jennifer Aniston explained to Variety that she and Courteney Cox kept laughing at bloopers of the show, which is so relatable. She said that they wanted to "find something to reference, an old Friends thing" and found tons of online bloopers. She joked that they were "like two nerds" because they kept watching them and laughing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's awesome that Cox and Aniston have remained so close and that their friendship has endured all of this time.
