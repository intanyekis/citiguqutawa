She held product manager positions at Johnson & Johnson and textile firm Beardsell. While still in college, She completed her summer internship with Booz Allen Hamilton. In 1980, Nooyi joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as a strategy consultant,&nbsp; and then worked at Motorola as Vice President and Director of Corporate Strategy and Planning, followed by a stint at Asea Brown Boveri.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=indra-nooyi-pepsico></span><span>Indra Nooyi PepsiCo</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She joined PepsiCo in 1994, and was named CEO in 2006, replacing Steven Reinemund, becoming the fifth CEO in PepsiCo’s 44-year history. Nooyi has directed the company’s global strategy for more than a decade and led PepsiCo’s restructuring, including the 1997 divestiture of Tricon, now known as Yum! Brands.</p><p>Tricon included companies like Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell under its umbrella. The financial gains from this spinoff allowed the company to increase the pace of its share buyback strategy, thereby giving it more leverage to pursue future acquisitions without as much shareholder backlash.</p><p>Nooyi also took the lead in the acquisition of Tropicana in 1998, and the merger with Quaker Oats Company, which also brought Gatorade in 2001. The $3.3 billion acquisition of Tropicana initially faced opposition from other PepsiCo executives and Wall Street critics.</p><p>Acquiring Tropicana allowed PepsiCo to gain a competitive edge; Tropicana at the time captured 44% of the chilled orange juice segment, the fastest growing segment of the juice market, an especially positive metric when compared to Coca-Cola’s Minute Maid which captured less than half of Tropicana’s market share.</p><p>The Quaker Oats Company’s ownership of Gatorade was a positive strategic move for PepsiCo, since Gatorade was responsible for 80% of sports drink sales at the time. Similar to the Tropicana acquisition, this strategic move gave PepsiCo leverage against Coca-Cola, owner of Powerade – second in the sports drink segment. PepsiCo’s annual net profit rose from $2.7 billion to $6.5 billion.</p><p>Nooyi was named on Wall Street Journal’s list of 50 women to watch in 2007 and 2008, and was listed among Time’s 100 Most Influential People in The World in 2007 and 2008. Forbes named her the #3 most powerful woman in 2008. In 2014, she was ranked #13 by Forbes. fortune ranked her the #1 most powerful woman in business in 2009 and 2010. On 7 October 2010, Fortune magazine ranked her the 6th most powerful woman in the world. In Fortune’s Most Powerful Women List of 2015, Nooyi ranked 2nd.</p><p>Nooyi’s strategic redirection of PepsiCo has been largely successful. She reclassified PepsiCo’s products into three categories: “fun for you” , “better for you”, and “good for you”. Her initiative was backed up with ample funding. She moved corporate spending away from junk foods and into the healthier alternatives, with the aim of improving the healthiness of even the “fun” offerings.In 2015, Nooyi removed aspartame from Diet Pepsi, furthering the shift towards healthier foods, despite lack of evidence of aspartame’s harmful effects.</p><p>Nooyi has stated an intent to develop a line of snacks marketed specifically for women, feeling that it is a hitherto unexplored category. In a radio interview, Nooyi stated that PepsiCo is getting ready to launch products designed and packaged according to women’s preferences, and based on behavioral differences in the way men and women consume snacks.</p><p>On August 6, 2018, PepsiCo confirmed that Nooyi would step down as CEO. Ramon Laguarta, a 22-year veteran of PepsiCo, replaced her on October 3, as well as becoming a member of the board of directors. However, Nooyi continued to serve as the chairwoman of the company until early 2019. During her tenure, the company’s sales grew 80%.

But if you can get people to follow you to the ends of the earth, you are a great leader.</li><li>Just because you are CEO, don’t think you have landed. You must continually increase your learning, the way you think, and the way you approach the organization. I’ve never forgotten that.</li><li>As a leader, I am tough on myself and I raise the standard for everybody; however, I am very caring because I want people to excel at what they are doing so that they can aspire to be me in the future.</li><li>Every year in consulting is like three years in the corporate world because you have multiple clients, multiple issues – you grow so much</li><li>I pick up the details that drive the organisation insane. But sweating the details is more important than anything else.</li><li>I wouldn’t ask anybody to do something I wouldn’t do myself.</li><li>“There’s constant reinvention: how you do business, how you deal with customers.”</li></ul><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Indra Nooyi</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-indra-nooyi></span><span>Who is Indra Nooyi?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in Madras, India, Indra Nooyi is an Indian-American business executive and former CEO of PepsiCo.
