Taylor Swift's fans have been hostile towards Kayla for a while now, interpreting anything she does or says as an attack on their favorite singer, and it seems the model finally had enough and decided to respond to swifties who were leaving mean comments on her social media.</p><h2 id=kayla-nicole-slammed-swifties-and-asked-them-to-leave-her-alone>Kayla Nicole Slammed Swifties And Asked Them To Leave Her Alone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-and-kayla-nicole-arrive-for-the-2018-espys-at-microsoft-theatre.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes fans can get a little too intense about their love for an artist, and swifties are no exception. Apparently, Kayla Nicole, Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend, was on the receiving end of attacks from Taylor Swift fans, who felt she had slammed Taylor's music.</p><p>While she's generally not that outspoken about her problems, it seems the online bashing got a little too much for the model, which is understandable, and she clapped back at swifties.</p><p><strong>"I’m unproblematic. Mind my business. Never respond to the constant vitriol. Solid as they come & don’t expect a pat on the back for it either," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she defended herself</a>. "Just know everyone has a breaking point & would love for 'yall' (because you know exactly who you are) to leave me alone."</strong></p><p><strong>She received, mostly, a lot of support from the comments on her post, and there were even some swifties who sent their love and asked other fans to stop hating on Kayla Nicole</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As a lifelong swiftie and a big fan of yours, I feel like I need to apologize on their behalf for how disgusting they are to you. you don’t deserve it at all and please know there are some of us who also love and respect you and wish they would just leave you alone," one user wrote, and was praised by other swifties.</p><h2 id=kayla-39-s-alleged-bashing-of-taylor-swift-39-s-music>Kayla's Alleged Bashing Of Taylor Swift's Music</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-the-tortured-poets-department.png><p>There was always a certain hostility towards Kayla Nicole for simply being Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend, but it noticeably ramped up after a particular tweet that swifties interpreted as her trashing Taylor's music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"There’s just no way I can fully digest all these new albums.

Others accused her of playing the victim, and provoking swifties just to claim they bully her, but it honestly seems like a stretch, since Kayla was simply praising Beyonce's new album.</p><p>Travis and Kayla dated for five years, so of course she was an important person in his life, but it seems they parted on good terms, and <a href=#>Kayla still gets along with the Kelce family</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lla16tLjApqpmq6ees7W1xKxkmqyklrCstc2gZKGdomKurbjEoJydpKlir6K%2Fx56bZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepGK6tr%2FInGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-ex-slams-swifties-attacking-her-allegedly-bashed-taylor-swift-music.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-kelce-ex-slams-swifties-attacking-her-allegedly-bashed-taylor-swift-music.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-ex-slams-swifties-attacking-her-allegedly-bashed-taylor-swift-music.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-kelce-ex-slams-swifties-attacking-her-allegedly-bashed-taylor-swift-music.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-ex-slams-swifties-attacking-her-allegedly-bashed-taylor-swift-music.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-ex-slams-swifties-attacking-her-allegedly-bashed-taylor-swift-music.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./richest-germans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./richest-germans.html>10 Richest People In Germany 2011 - Manager Magazin Rich List</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./college-football-championship-week-questions-power-auer-podcast.html>Submit your questions for the Power Auer podcast</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./college-football-championship-week-questions-power-auer-podcast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
