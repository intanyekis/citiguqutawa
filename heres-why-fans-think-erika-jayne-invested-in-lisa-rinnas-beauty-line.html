There are questions surrounding <a href=#>whether Erika Jayne spends Tom Girardi's money</a> and <a href=#>the cast talks about Erika's divorce</a> in many episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that Erika's co-star Lisa Rinna has released her own line of beauty products, fans are wondering if Erika has invested in Rinna Beauty. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=did-it-happen>Did It Happen?</h2><p>Lisa Rinna has <a href=#>celebrated releasing her beauty brand at 57 years old</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna's Watch What Happens Live appearance</a> gave fans some juicy details. Someone asked the reality star, "Are you not making Erika own it [this season] because she invested in your makeup line?"</p><p>Lisa said that despite the rumors that are going around, this isn't something that happened at all.</p><p>Lisa said, "[Erika] did not invest in [Rinna Beauty], let's get that really straight right now. That was a very terrible rumor. I mean, I would never borrow money from anybody. I have a partner that I'm in business with, Erika did not give me a dime. And by the way, I would never borrow money from a friend. Don't ever borrow money from a friend — don't ever get into business with a friend!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa Rinna's advice is definitely smart as going into business with friends can be tricky, and so can asking them for money.</p><p>Fans also think that Lisa Rinna should question Erika Jayne more on this season of RHOBH. According to Us Weekly, Lisa said that she is certain that Erika was in the dark about what was going on. Lisa explained, “I’ve known Erika a long time, I don’t think she knew anything. … Why would Tom Girardi tell Erika anything? The lawyers didn’t even know. That is how I feel, I’m going to stand by it. If I’m wrong, I’ll f—king deal with it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa also said, “Do I have to carry the show on my back? No. … Seriously though, there are other people here, there are eight of us.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Can Never Forget About This ‘RHOBH’ Fight</a></span></p><h2 id=rinna-beauty>Rinna Beauty</h2><p>Lisa Rinna came out with Rinna Beauty in November 2020, and Lisa's brand has lip kits that are definitely a perfect fit for the actress and reality star, since people always talk about Lisa's lips.</p><p>The lip kits have really fun names, from No Apologies to Birthday Suit to Legends Only, and the colors range from nude to pink to red.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna shared that her mom always wore lipstick</a> and it sounds like that has been a huge inspiration. Fans of RHOBH have seen Lisa's mom Lois appear in some episodes, and she's always sweet and totally fabulous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Page Six, Lisa said, “My mom was always someone who had her face on, and that meant lipstick. She never left the house without it. All I remember, from the earliest age, is that was what made my mom feel comfortable going out into the world.”</p><p>It sounds like this has been something that Lisa Rinna has really wanted to do: she told Forbes.com, “This was always a dream of mine and a passion. I had my lips done when I was 24 years old. I always call myself ‘the lip pioneer’ which is so silly and fun and stupid and funny. Why can’t I make money off of this? Why can’t I build a brand?”</p><p>The lip kits have been getting lots of buzz, with Lisa telling Allure.com that she wanted to come out with a lip product around a decade ago. She said that things kept going wrong and since she has been selling clothes on QVC for a while, she figured that maybe that was where she had to put her attention. Thankfully, it totally worked out and it seems like Lisa is really enjoying it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'RHOBH' Has A Higher Net Worth: Dorit Kemsley Or Erika Jayne?</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-39-s-39-rhobh-39-time>Lisa's 'RHOBH' Time</h2><p>Lisa Rinna's seasons of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills have been fascinating to watch. She had conflict with Kim Richards for a long time, and in season 11, she has talked about her daughter Amelia dating the older Scott Disick.</p><p>Fans have also gotten the chance to see Lisa and Harry Hamlin hanging out at home in some scenes, and Lisa introduced viewers to Harry's beautiful garden in their backyard.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'RHOBH' Mid-Season Drama: This Is What Fans Are Saying About Sutton And Garcelle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's good that Lisa Rinna cleared up the false rumor about Erika Jayne investing in her line of lip kits. Curious fans can check them out at her website and it's a fun product since each lip kit comes with a lipstick, lip gloss, and lip liner.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>All The Men & Women Brandi Glanville From 'RHOBH' Has Been Linked To</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2LBqbXNpGSeqpmgrm62wLKlnmWZo8Omv9Oem2ahnmK5qr%2FAZqmipp6WwG6uxJqsrbFdobavsY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-fans-think-erika-jayne-invested-in-lisa-rinnas-beauty-line.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-why-fans-think-erika-jayne-invested-in-lisa-rinnas-beauty-line.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-fans-think-erika-jayne-invested-in-lisa-rinnas-beauty-line.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-why-fans-think-erika-jayne-invested-in-lisa-rinnas-beauty-line.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-fans-think-erika-jayne-invested-in-lisa-rinnas-beauty-line.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-fans-think-erika-jayne-invested-in-lisa-rinnas-beauty-line.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./masataka-taniguchi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-168614-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./masataka-taniguchi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-168614-html.html>Masataka Taniguchi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./travis-kelce-taylor-swift-phone-number-eras-tour-video.html>Travis Kelce Tried To Give Taylor Swift His Phone Number: Video Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./travis-kelce-taylor-swift-phone-number-eras-tour-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
