He started a relationship with Emily Ratajkowski in November 2022. After that, he started seeing Chase Sui Wonders. As of this writing, he doesn't seem to be dating anyone new, though.</p><h2 id=what-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now>What Is Chase Sui Wonders Doing Now?</h2><p>It was fun to watch Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders co-star in the horror movie Bodies Bodies Bodies, which was released in March 2022. In fact, the actors played a couple named David and Emma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chase-sui-city-on-fire-premiere.jpg><p>As they hang out in a big house in the country with their friend group and someone dies, it becomes clear that David and Emma have some relationship problems. They had a lot of chemistry in all of their scenes together.</p><p>After Wonders and Davidson broke up, Wonders shared a photo on her Instagram account on August 28, 2023, according to The Daily Mail. She was on vacation and seemed happy and relaxed. While of course fans can guess that both actors were upset by the breakup, she definitely looked great.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chase-sui-wonders-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Wonders has been getting out and having fun. She attended the Proenza Schouler show at New York Fashion Week in September 2023. She posted a photo from her front row seat on Instagram and fans were excited to see that she was with Molly Gordon, The Bear star Ayo Edebiri, her Bodies Bodies Bodies co-star Rachel Sennott, and Emma Seligman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Childhood Disorder Took Away Chase Sui Wonders' Voice For Years Before She Was Famous</a></span></p><p>In mid-September 2023, Wonders posted on Instagram that she attended an event for "Sofia Coppola Archive: 1999-2023," the book that Sofia Coppola is currently promoting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chase-sui-wonders-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for whether the actress is dating again, there are no reports that she has someone new in her life. She might be keeping that quiet, or she might still be single.</p><p>Chase Sui Wonders's life definitely looks different right now since actors aren't filming any projects because of the WGA/SAF-AFTRA strike that began on May 2nd, 2023. She also isn't able to give interviews where she is promoting anything that has recently been released.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Chase Sui Wonders Was Discovered By Sofia Coppola</a></span></p><p>Besides that, it seems that Wonders is still living in New York City, which she has been for a while. In April 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chloe Fineman and Chase Sui Wonders chatted</a> for Interview Magazine and Wonders shared that she had an apartment in the East Village. She joked about how everyone living there was very young and that she wasn't sure that she fit in anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/did-chase-sui-wonders-net-worth-explode-as-soon-as-she-started-dating-pete-davidson_-here-s-the-truth-about-her-career.jpg><p>Wonders also mentioned that she was writing for TV, which is interesting. She said, "I’m just getting back into town, getting my life in order. I’m writing today. I’ve been working on this TV script for a while. We’re trying to push it across the finish line and get all the kinks out."</p><p>Wonders hasn't shared any more information about her writing. It's possible that she is still in the midst of the creative process and there haven't been any updates to share. Of course, with the ongoing strike, no TV show or movie deals or being made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/chase-sui-wonders.jpg><p>While she hasn't explained how she is spending her time now that she is no longer dating Pete Davidson, Chase Sui Wonders has always been super creative. In 2021, she said in an interview with W Magazine that when she lived with her mom at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, she did a lot of drawing.</p><p>Wonders said, "Even if I didn’t do anything all day, I would make an attempt to draw because even as quiet and mundane and maddening as that time was, drawing taps into a meditative state,” she said.</p><p>“It’s such a quiet and calm act and not always stimulating, but I tap into a state where I’m spending time and attention doing something and it feels like a recharge. You can just laser your focus in on something creative. I definitely turn to it as a coping mechanism.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson-bodies-bodies-bodies-01-700x400-1.jpg><p>Chase Sui Wonders isn't able to do any more promotion for her latest TV shows Bupkis, which also stars Pete Davidson, or City on Fire. Her next project is a movie called Little Death that also stars Jena Malone and David Schwimmer. According to the movie's IMDb page, it's currently in post-production. Whenever the strike ends, it seems likely that Little Death will be released, and fans will be glad to see Wonders star in this film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKhmKydXajCqnnWqKWdnaKoeqW7yKeeZqafrHqistOeqWaaopqurLXNoGSuqF2strW0jKmcrZ1dma63tcOspqdn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-chase-sui-wonders-doing-now-after-breaking-up-with-pete-davidson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./he-was-on-the-knifes-edge-bryan-kohbergers-classmate-opens-up-about-idaho-murder-suspects-behavior-after-killings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./he-was-on-the-knifes-edge-bryan-kohbergers-classmate-opens-up-about-idaho-murder-suspects-behavior-after-killings.html>He was on the knifes edge: Bryan Kohbergers classmate opens up about Idaho murder suspec</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-between-hayden-panettiere-and-milo-ventimiglias-relationship.html>What Happened Between Milo Ventimiglia And Hayden Panettiere?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-between-hayden-panettiere-and-milo-ventimiglias-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
