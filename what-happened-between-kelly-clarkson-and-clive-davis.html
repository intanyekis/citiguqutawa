Clarkson was unstoppable at this point in her career, but what fans didn’t know was that she had been having a lot of disputes with her record label executives, with music industry vet Clive Davis having once described the singer as difficult to work with. Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-kelly-clarkson-hard-to-work-with>Is Kelly Clarkson Hard To Work With?</h2><p>Clarkson worked with Davis from the beginning of her career, when she inked her record deal with RCA and Syco.</p><p>But in February 2013, the music mogul made some bold claims about the pop star in his tell-all memoir The Soundtrack of My Life, including claims that Clarkson had shown diva-like behavior while they were putting together her third album, My December.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Describe Kelly Clarkson's Cover Of Gwen Stefani's 'Misery' As 'Queens Supporting Queens'</a></span></p><p>When the record was played to Davis in full, he believed there weren’t any potential radio-friendly songs, which worried him since both of Clarkson’s previous albums were very much driven around Pop music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He recalled having a conversation with the Piece by Piece singer’s manager at the time, saying that they would be out of their mind to release the album without any potential hits.</p><p>In the book, Davis boldly said that he believes the record ended up underperforming because Clarkson had co-written most of the tracks, and since she didn’t want to take his advice to rework the project and produce more radio-friendly songs, it ultimately affected the record’s overall chart performance.</p><p>In response to that, Clarkson wasted no time to write a statement in response to what she had read about herself in Davis’ book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Clarkson Dragged For The Title Of Her New Christmas Single 'Christmas Isn't Canceled (Just You)'</a></span></p><p>“Well, first let me say, I've co-penned many of my ‘pop hits,’” she gushed. “Secondly, My December went platinum (It sold 20,000 less than All I Ever Wanted which followed My December.) Hardly a huge failure."</p><p>“Never Again, the ONLY single they released in the US from that record was a Top 10 hit.</p><p>“I am very proud of that and I have my fans to thank. But, again, what's most interesting about his story is what he leaves out: He doesn't mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project.”</p><h2 id=did-kelly-refuse-to-sing-since-u-been-gone>Did Kelly Refuse To Sing Since U Been Gone?</h2><p>According to Davis’ book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarkson threw a tantrum in his office</a> when he demanded that Since U Been Gone — which is the singer’s best-selling song of her career — was to be featured on her second album, Breakaway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, the mother-of-two didn’t like the track and supposedly wanted to scrap it the minute she heard it, and it became a back and forth argument between Davis and Clarkson, with the latter eventually giving in to put the song on her album after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Slams Carrie Underwood, Claiming Kelly Clarkson As The Elite ‘American Idol’ Winner</a></span></p><p>But Clarkson’s recollection was rather different.</p><p>She continued to explain that she was actually at war with Davis because he had called her a “sh**ty writer” who should be grateful of the music career that had been handed to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I did cry in his office once. I cried after I played him a song I had written about my life called Because Of You,” she explained.</p><p>“I cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that I was a "s****y writer" who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me.</p><p>Clarkson added: “He continued on about how the song didn't rhyme and how I should just shut up and sing. This was devastating coming from a man who I, as a young girl, considered a musical hero and was so honoured to work with.”</p><p>The pair have not worked together ever since, though Davis went on to say that he “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still believes in her [Kelly] as an artist</a>.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Kelly Clarkson's TV Career, From Starting Her Own Talk Show To Replacing Ellen DeGeneres</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmo5Whubp5wqWYq6OjpLturc2dZJykmauybrDAr6CsZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-kelly-clarkson-and-clive-davis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-kelly-clarkson-and-clive-davis.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-kelly-clarkson-and-clive-davis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-kelly-clarkson-and-clive-davis.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-kelly-clarkson-and-clive-davis.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-kelly-clarkson-and-clive-davis.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-mike-modano-wife-allison-micheletti-know-her-age-wikipedia-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-mike-modano-wife-allison-micheletti-know-her-age-wikipedia-2.html>Who Is Mike Modano Wife Allison Micheletti?
