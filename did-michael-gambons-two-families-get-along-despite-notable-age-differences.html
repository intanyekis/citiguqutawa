Following their nuptials all those years ago, Miller and Gambon remained married for more than sixty years until he passed.</p><p>According to reports, Gambon and his wife principally shared a £5 million home in the English town of Gravesend. Surprisingly enough, however, it turns out that Gambon made another home with his second family in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-gambon-looking-shocked.jpg><p>According to The Sun, Michael Gambon had a life-changing moment on the set of the Channel One show Longitude.

Instead, Gambon's wife and girlfriend reportedly were completely aware of each other.

According to a report from The Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miller initially was "devastated" by the situation and even moved out of the home</a> she shared with Gambon. However, Miller reportedly had a change of heart.</p><p>"Lady Gambon was said to initially have been devastated by the news of her husband's other relationship and moved out of the home they shared.
