ピカンチファイヴの三代目ボーカルとして有名ですが、
現在では歌手活動だけでなくデザイナー、モデル、ナレーターの仕事もされてます。
既に５７歳になる野宮真貴さんですが、
いまだに容姿的な魅力を保ち続け、
多くの女性かた注目を集めています。
長年、その時代に合った自分いれたという、
その年齢相応な自分の味を知っている意味でも、
野宮真貴さんは素晴らしいのです。
野宮真貴さん、57歳。21歳で歌手デビューしてから、36年の間ステージに立ち続けている。彼女がボーカルを務めた「ピチカート・ファイヴ」は、渋谷系バンドとして大ブレイクを遂げる。ピチカートに加入したのは1989年。29歳のときだった。それから約30年、人形のような美しさは健在だ。とはいえ、10月に発売された著書『おしゃれはほどほどでいい』には、「ハリを失った肌」、「シワ」、「老眼鏡」といった文字が並ぶ。それでも、彼女は「案外、今の私は悪くないわ」と笑う。なぜ、「経年変化」を肯定的に捉えられるのだろうか？引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20171202-00010001-bfj-ent
各年代のトレンドに負けずに、
若作りをするわけでもなく、
背伸びして大人ぶるわけでもなく、
自分らしくい続けたことが、
野宮真貴さんの一番のすごさだと思います。
現在では髪も肌も劣化した自分を受け入れながらも、
今の自分を愛してやまないそうです。
以前まではツヤツヤのトリートメントを心かけていたそうですが、
その後に老けた顔の自分の髪だけが若いことに違和感を感じ、
無理をすると逆に老けて見えることを発見したそうです。
野宮真貴 経年変化 野宮真貴さんといえば、
ピチカートファイヴのイメージが強いですが、
下積み時代の当時はOLもしていたそうです。
お金がなくても音楽とファッションがあれば幸せだったようですが、
当時からのファッションのへの考え方がすごいのです。
トレンドや男ウケを全く無視し、
モテなくて良いと開き直っていたそうです。
おそらく、男性目線を無視したことで、
今までの野宮真貴の個性があったのでしょう！
また子供の育児を楽しんでいたのも、
良い点だったようです。
歳を重ねて目が悪くなったとき、
老眼を恥ずかしいものではなくて、
おしゃれアイテムだと思っていたそうです。
そうそう、オフィスに伺いました（笑）。年齢を重ねることをネガティブに考えていくと、寂しくなっちゃうじゃないですか。でも、デザインが可愛ければ、老眼鏡だっておしゃれアイテム。年を取ったからこそ身につけられるモノってあるんですよ。そうすると、年齢を重ねるのも悪くないかなって思えますよね。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20171202-00010001-bfj-ent&p=3
歳をとっているからこそ身につけられるもの、
そういう考え方が若いうちからあったのかすごいですね、
普通の女性は若さへの執着にこだわりますから。
若さが全てではなくて、
歳を重ねたからこその「今」を、
野宮真貴さんは効率的に大切にしているのです。
野宮真貴さんがプロデュースした老眼は、
芸術そのもので、もはや若い女性が嫉妬するレベルです。
その年齢に合ったファッションを、
掘り下げていく時代がいつか来ると思っていましたが、
それを始めるのは野宮真貴さんのようなデザイナーなのかもしれません。
野宮真貴の旦那・昼間徹史と息子の名前と大学(画像・動画) 野宮真貴さんといえば、
１９９６年に音楽プロデューサーの昼間さんと結婚されました。（当時はフジ局員）
同じ年に息子を出産し、
野宮真貴さんは育児に励んでました。
息子さんはその後に大学の医学部に進学したようですが、
かなり勉強を頑張れたそうです。
育児に関する苦労話も多くされますが、
それだけ愛情を持った育てた成果があったようです。
ちなみに息子さんの名前も顔も非公開ですが、
医者としての将来を考えたら、
メディア的には面白く、報道されるかもしれません。
また、通っていた大学はどこなのか不明ですが、
個人的には良い大学なのかな？と予想しています。
野宮真貴さんはバンドマンとしてだけでなく、
女性としての幸せも求めて、
バンドが一番忙しい時期に結婚し、子供を出産されました。
頭の中のバランスまでもがおしゃれに見えて、
個人的には羨ましいです。</p><footer><a href=../../post-5162.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../boi-1da-talks-new-drake-album-bow-wow-and-keri-hilson-tracks-soulja-boys-album-sales-39572.html>Boi-1da Talks New Drake Album, Bow Wow And Keri Hilson Tracks + Soulja Boys Album Sales</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

若い頃の河合奈保子の美しさ！昔のアイドルの中では圧倒的な愛嬌。スカート事件は本当？ 都会的なイメージのある河合奈保子さんですが、実は関西出身のアイドルです。
また、妹っぽい愛嬌が魅力の彼女でありましたが、3歳年下の妹がいる長女であります。
