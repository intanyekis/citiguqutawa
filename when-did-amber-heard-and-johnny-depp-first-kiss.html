Reviews were also mediocre at best.</p><p>However, for Amber Heard, getting on the film was a very big deal, especially given that talent involved which included Johnny Depp, Aaron Eckhart and Giovanni Ribisi.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Much Was Johnny Depp Set To Make For ‘Pirates 6’ Before Being Fired?</a></span></p><p>Heard revealed over a decade ago alongside Collider that <a href=#>the audition process was not an easy one</a> and quite stressful.</p><p>"It’s a prestigious movie and it’s got a great, talented cast, so they wanted to make sure they had the right person for the role, but it was a torturous process. It was painful. I found out that they were making this movie and my heart fluttered."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember thinking, “Oh, wouldn’t that be amazing,” but didn’t really consider it, in a real way, as a possibility.

He kind of playfully pushed me down on this bed, sofa. Playful and flirtatious. And he said, ‘Yum.’ And kind of lifted his eyebrows up like that."</p><p>Amber would later claim that the relationship intensified in her hotel room during their press tour for the film.</p><p>"We fell in love. We were traveling around talking about this movie that we participated in together. We spent the night together in my hotel room and for the rest of the press tour."</p><p>Of course, things were very different at the time and in addition, Heard had a much different take on her relationship with Johnny Depp, especially when it came to the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=at-the-time-heard-raved-about-her-experience-alongside-depp-in-the-film>At The Time, Heard Raved About Her Experience Alongside Depp In The Film</h2><p>It was a different time for Amber Heard.

I got along with him, splendidly. He’s charming and wonderful to work with. He’s a dream. It was such a creative environment.

I'm a huge fan of Hunter S. Thompson and I met with Johnny Depp about it and he was instrumental in casting me as Chenault, who plays Johnny's character's love interest."</p><p>"So I was playing his love interest along with Aaron Eckhart and there a slew of other brilliant filmmakers and actors in this movie and involved in this movie. It's directed and written by Bruce Robinson and like I said before it's a Hunter S. Thompson story and I am just honored to be working on something he was involved in any way."</p><p>It'll be interesting to see how Heard's acting career shifts following her court battle with Johnny Depp.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Here's How Johnny Depp Would Constantly Troll David Letterman During Interviews</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2eYrGqsIyapJudomK1pq3RnWSappRit7C0zaewZpyVpb1ussirqq1lm57AtHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-did-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-first-kiss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-did-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-first-kiss.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-did-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-first-kiss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-did-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-first-kiss.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-did-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-first-kiss.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-did-amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-first-kiss.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./based-on-a-true-story-burning-questions-after-season-1-finale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./based-on-a-true-story-burning-questions-after-season-1-finale.html>'Based on a True Story Burning Questions After Season 1 Finale</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-woody-allen-wife-harlene-rosen.html>What Happened To Woody Allen's Mysterious Ex-Wife Harlene Rosen?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-woody-allen-wife-harlene-rosen.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
