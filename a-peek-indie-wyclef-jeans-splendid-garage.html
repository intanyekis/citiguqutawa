Along with his siblings, <a href=#>Jean played music on the Muppets’ musical instruments</a> before their parents gifted them real instruments to create melodies. After attending music college, he became a part of the band Tranzlator Crew in the 1980s and later changed the name to Fugees after being signed with Columbia Records. Until 1997, the band released two albums and managed to win two Grammy Awards for their work, selling millions of copies worldwide. After disbanding, Wyclef Jean began his solo career and <a href=#>co-produced songs with stars such as Whitney Houston</a> and Shakira. He has amassed a $10 million fortune through his diligent work in the music industry.</p><p>Wyclef Jean spends his millions on philanthropic ventures but also likes to keep things classy at home as he has a stunning car collection that features a combination of vintage and new cars. Let’s look at the most expensive cars in Wyclef Jean’s garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce-silver-cloud-60-500>Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud ($60,500)</h2><p>A vintage car on the list, the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud was the first car by the automaker that custom coachbuilders made after the chassis was produced. The first iteration was produced in 1955, with Jean owning the 1958 version of the car. The 1958 model comes with a six-cylinder engine and an old elegant charm only seen in a Rolls-Royce.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Kyrie Irving's Million Dollar Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom-460-000>Rolls-Royce Phantom ($460,000)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ultimate status symbol car of the 21st century, it is no surprise that Wyclef Jean has one of the best luxury cars in his collection. The Rolls-Royce Phantom is known for its stunning interior with real metal accents and fine leather cabin. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>, the Phantom features power-adjustable massage rear seats with remote control for the infotainment and a refrigerator.</p><h2 id=lamborghini-murcielago-210-000>Lamborghini Murcielago ($210,000)</h2><p>A Lamborghini has become a staple supercar to be owned by hip-hop celebrities, and it is not a surprise that Wyclef Jean has a Murcielago in his garage. The Murcielago garnered quick attention for its scissor doors and sleek design. Lamborghini ran production between 2001 and 2010, and only 4,099 units were produced for retail.</p><h2 id=mclaren-f1-1-million>McLaren F1 ($1 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most expensive cars in Jean’s garage, the McLaren F1 is the supercar that puts an end to all the supercars in the world. With only 106 examples produced by McLaren, the F1 is a rare car to find on the streets. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, the most expensive F1 sold at the Gooding & Co. auction in August 2021 for a whopping $20.5 million. The F1 owned by Wyclef Jean will surely increase in value over time.</p><h2 id=bentley-arnage-31-900>Bentley Arnage ($31,900)</h2><p>A car for everyday use, the Bentley Arnage is a four-door flagship vehicle that was first released in 1998. The Arnage was a special model, the first product introduced after Volkswagen purchased Bentley. Even after several iterations, the Arnage remains one of the most classic today and in Jean’s collection.</p><h2 id=ferrari-360-spider-197-000>Ferrari 360 Spider ($197,000)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An affordable supercar introduced by Ferrari, the 360 Spider marked the beginning of a new age for the brand when it was introduced in 1999. Jean’s 360 Spider is a special car as the iteration was the last to use the Dino V8 engine and have a 6-speech manual transmission. The car is an extremely rare find as the model was only produced until 2005, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motor Biscuit</a>.</p><h2 id=hummer-h2-55-000>Hummer H2 ($55,000)</h2><p>A slight upgrade from Hummer H1, Wyclef Jean owns the 2003 Hummer H2, the first year the car hit the market. The Hummer H2 can be used for an adventurous ride with a sturdy exterior and comfortable interior. More robust than ever, the H2 is the optimum vehicle to drive along the rocky terrains near his residence in New Jersey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pagani-zonda-c12-1-1-million>Pagani Zonda C12 ($1.1 million)</h2><p>The first supercar by Pagani, the automaker, went big when it produced the Zonda C12 to compete with the Italian supercar market. The production of the Zonda C12 began in 1999, and only 140 cars were made until it was discontinued in 2019, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a>. Wyclef Jean is often photographed in the Zonda C12, which the rapper owns in the shade of cherry red.</p><h2 id=cadillac-eldorado-biarritz-13-075>Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz ($13,075)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the era of chrome cars of the 1950s, the Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz was an elite car to be owned. Designed by Harley Earl, the Eldorado Biarritz came with an elegant design and elongated tail fins. The combination of power and presence remains unmatched today, and the Cadillac is often seen at auctions today, sold for upwards of $140,000.</p><p>Another notable car in Wyclef Jean’s collection includes a Mercedes G-Class. However, the model number is unknown. The rapper has created an impressive fleet of vehicles valued at over $3 million. As Jean continues to pursue music and perform at various events in the United States, more supercars will be added to his garage.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Jamie Dornan Made It Big In Hollywood And Made His $15 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motor Biscuit</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7DInmSwsZOhsqd5yZ6Yp6tdqL2tsc2doJ1ll5a%2ForPEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-peek-indie-wyclef-jeans-splendid-garage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-peek-indie-wyclef-jeans-splendid-garage.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-peek-indie-wyclef-jeans-splendid-garage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-peek-indie-wyclef-jeans-splendid-garage.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-peek-indie-wyclef-jeans-splendid-garage.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-peek-indie-wyclef-jeans-splendid-garage.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-christina-applegate-have-breast-cancer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-christina-applegate-have-breast-cancer.html>Did Christina Applegate Have Breast Cancer?
