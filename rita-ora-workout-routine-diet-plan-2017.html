Though she likes experimenting new things to stay fit (having admitted to eating raw kale or trying juice detox in the past), she has now found the best methods of keeping fit that suit her needs. Here, we have listed her workout routine and her usual diet plan that’s not too complicated. So, it can be followed easily. You can also know her views on body image, body confidence and what methods she uses to stay body confident in order to get some inspiration.</p><h3><strong>Workout</strong> <strong>Routine</strong></h3><p>The workout routine of the stunner involves doing toning exercises and yoga regularly. She is not so fond of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>running</a> but does it for 10-15 minutes in order to stay fit. She also loves <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Barrecore</a> workouts. Mostly, she has to trick herself into doing an exercise. The ones she does more frequently are dancing and hiking with her friends.</p><h3><strong>Workout</strong> <strong>Aim</strong></h3><p>The singer admits that she is not the skinniest person in the world and is not trying to be skinny. Her focus is on toning her body. She says that everyone should try to tone their bodies as it comes more naturally as compared to being thin.</p><figure id=attachment_59108 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59108 style=width:462px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Rita Ora in her workout gear</figure><h3><strong>Diet Plan</strong></h3><p>The eating plan of the diva is very simple.</p><p>She has smoothies in the mornings and has a couple of eggs too.</p><p>During lunch, she has some chicken and salmon.</p><p>Dinner usually includes having some truffle pasta, Broccoli pasta or some pizza, reports the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Cosmopolitan UK</a>.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secrets</strong></h3><p>The biggest diet secret of the British celebrity is she watches what she eats and cuts her portions in half. If she wants a burger, she will have half of it. Or she will take the bread off and eat only the stuffing. If she wants fries, she will skip the burger and have only those fries.</p><figure id=attachment_59106 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59106 style=width:580px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Rita Ora with her favorite fries</figure><h3><strong>Diet Indulgence</strong></h3><p>The actress likes to indulge with sugary fizzy drinks, especially the ones with different colors. If the portion is too big, she will curtail it and enjoy the delicacy.</p><h3><strong>Not Body Confident</strong></h3><p>The Hot Right Now (2012) star recently admitted that she doesn’t feel confident with her body. She never thought that she has a perfect body or a perfect size, reports <a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Yahoo</a>.</p><h3><strong>Body Doubts of Women</strong></h3><p>The host and judge of America’s Next Top Model (2013-Present) think&nbsp;that every woman has body doubts and they don’t often like a part of their body. It is a very normal thing. This is the reason why she asked a plus sized model to be a judge on America’s Next Top Model with her. It will help people to see these norms on TV and in media. She believes that the more you stick together, the more power you will create. She wants people to understand that everyone is beautiful no matter what their body shapes are. It breaks her heart when some people refuse to leave home thinking that they are not good looking enough.</p><figure id=attachment_59104 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59104 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Rita Ora flaunts her bikini body in Tezenis Campaign 2016</figure><h3><strong>How She Motivates Herself to Feel Self Confident in Her Body?</strong></h3><p>The fashion designer says that she often has days when she feels low about her body. At those times, she thinks about all the young girls who need inspiration. She reminds herself that she needs to inspire all her social media followers and takes the position of a role model very seriously. She appreciates and admires the task of helping people realize that they are beautiful the way they are.</p><figure id=attachment_59107 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59107 style=width:488px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Rita Ora hot in Versace Spring / Summer 2016 Show during Paris Fashion Week</figure><h3><strong>Body Confidence Tip</strong></h3><p>To boost her own body confidence, Rita opts for a fun workout or takes the assistance of her friends. She says that her team also keeps her grounded. Her stylist is her best friend and her sister works in her management team. She has also had the same team manager working for her since the beginning. Having great company around keeps her grounded. So, her advice to the fans is to surround yourself with people who love you for who you are and make you feel confident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqugrZldpL%2BiedaoqaSnpal6s7vUraCnnV2ZtqbAjKmjmqZdZ31yg44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frita-ora-workout-routine-diet-plan-2017.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frita-ora-workout-routine-diet-plan-2017.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frita-ora-workout-routine-diet-plan-2017.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frita-ora-workout-routine-diet-plan-2017.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frita-ora-workout-routine-diet-plan-2017.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frita-ora-workout-routine-diet-plan-2017.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-10-highest-grossing-movies-of-george-lucas-besides-star-wars-ranked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-10-highest-grossing-movies-of-george-lucas-besides-star-wars-ranked.html>The 10 Highest-Grossing Movies Of George Lucas Besides 'Star Wars', Ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christie-hefner.html>Hugh Hefner's Daughter, Christie Hefner Stayed In A Marital Relationship From 1995 To 2013.
