In fact, the powers that be in Hollywood seem to love producing them so much that at any given time <a href=#>there are lots of musicals in the making</a>. Despite the popularity of the genre, the truth remains that only <a href=#>a handful of musical movies have gone on to be considered classics</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Actors Won Their Oscars For Musicals?</a></span>When people talk about the top movie musicals of all time, a lot of people think that Grease deserves to top that list. In fact, there are a lot of fans that think that <a href=#>Grease is the perfect musical</a>. As a result, anyone who was involved in making the film has something to be proud of, including Eddie Deezen. Unfortunately for Deezen, however, after years of success in the acting world, his life took a dramatic turn recently with him being charged with serious crimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-eddie-deezen-famous-for>What Is Eddie Deezen Famous For?</h2><p>In Hollywood, there is a long tradition of actors who seemingly were born to be a star taking the movie business by storm. On the other hand, from the moment that Eddie Deezen became a professional actor, it seemed very clear that he was destined to be a successful character actor. Blessed with the perfect look and voice to play the kind of stereotypical nerd that appeared in movies from past decades, Deezen wound up landing a long list of roles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Background Actors That Seem To Pop Up Everywhere</a></span></p><p>In the year 1978, Eddie Deezen made his big screen debut in a pair of movies. While one of those films titled Laserblast has mostly been forgotten, the other movie went on to be considered an all-time classic, Grease. Cast as Eugene Felsnic in Grease, Deezen certainly wasn’t the movie’s main star but he made the most of every second he appeared onscreen. As a result, Deezen wound up reprising the role in the far less acclaimed 1982 sequel Grease 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Eddie Deezen has appeared in lots of movies that had nothing to do with Grease. For example, Deezen had roles in movies like 1941, Midnight Madness, Wargames, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, and The Polar Express among others. Also a successful television actor, Deezen appeared in shows like Magnum P.I. and Punky Brewster. Much more notably, Deezen lent his voice to shows like Duckman, Dexter's Laboratory, Life with Louie, Kim Possible, Johnny Bravo, and The Weird Al Show.</p><h2 id=eddie-deezen-rsquo-s-recent-legal-troubles>Eddie Deezen’s Recent Legal Troubles</h2><p>Considering that Eddie Deezen has been in the public eye to some degree since the late-1970s and had never had any issues, there was no reason to expect he would become scandalous. Despite that, now that Deezen is in his sixties, the actor has shockingly found himself in serious legal jeopardy seemingly out of nowhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is Twitter Not Okay With A 'Grease' Prequel?</a></span></p><p>On September 16th of 2021, Eddie Deezen went out to a Maryland restaurant. If any of the patrons or workers at that restaurant knew who Deezen was before that night and were excited to see him in real life, they certainly didn’t feel that way for very long. After all, the restaurant wound up telling Deezen to leave for an unknown reason and the actor refused to. As a result, the police were called to come to make Deezen leave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a TMZ report about what happened when the police arrived to make Eddie Deezen exit a Maryland restaurant, the actor refused to follow the cops’ instructions. Instead, Deezen reportedly hid behind a woman, and then he allegedly threw plates, bowls, and food at the cops, striking one of them in the process. As a result of one of the cops being struck by something Deezen threw, he was arrested, taken to jail, and charged with second-degree assault, disorderly conduct, and trespassing.</p><p>Since Eddie Deezen had never gotten into trouble before 2021, it was easy to assume his restaurant arrest was a strange blip in his life. As it would turn out, however, that wasn’t the case as the actor got arrested again in 2022 and the second time he was charged with an even more serious crime. After all, according to Maryland Police, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Deezen was charged with fourth-degree burglary</a>, two counts of trespassing, and one count of disturbing the peace.</p><p>When People asked the Maryland police for a statement, this is how they described the situation that led to Eddie Deezen being charged with those crimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to a preliminary investigation, a female opened the door and Deezen pushed his way inside. She advised Deezen made unwanted entry into the residence and almost made it into one of the residence's rooms before they were able to get him to exit the residence. She advised Deezen then went outside but refused to leave the property, which is posted with a no trespassing sign." Furthermore, the police stated that there have been "several issues with Deezen leaving items at the residence and various types of notes with the items."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On August 9th of 2022, Eddie Deezen’s recent criminal charges were put into a new perspective. After all, on that day it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deezen was being transferred to the Maryland Department of Health</a> for treatment after being found not competent to stand trial. According to court documents, Deezen is considered a danger to himself and others. Hopefully, Deezen will get the treatment he needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brHDnaCeZZSasruxzWaeq52RqLJur9GipKKmkaF6s7HCqKmdZWJlf3N7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-eddie-deezen-grease-criminal-record-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-eddie-deezen-grease-criminal-record-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-eddie-deezen-grease-criminal-record-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-eddie-deezen-grease-criminal-record-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-eddie-deezen-grease-criminal-record-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-eddie-deezen-grease-criminal-record-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-may-siblings-does-caleb-mclaughlin-have-here-is-everything-to-know-about-stranger-things-cast-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-may-siblings-does-caleb-mclaughlin-have-here-is-everything-to-know-about-stranger-things-cast-2.html>How May Siblings Does Caleb McLaughlin Have?
