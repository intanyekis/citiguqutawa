He couldn't accompany her much in the past few months, because he couldn't really leave the country during the season, so he wasn't able cheer her on as much as she did him. But that's about to change.</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift is now embarking on another leg of her Eras tour, and Travis will be joining her on the journey.</strong> "After the Super Bowl, Travis will be joining Taylor on her tour and traveling with her," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source shared a few days ago</a>. "They are happy and looking forward to spending more time together."</p><p>No one knows where their relationship will go from there, but it seems they are on the right track for now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigpqifp8GiutNmqK6do6m2sLqMramarpmoeqyxy5ycZpmjoLKledOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSsraCav26uzrCjZpmWqbKzec%2Baqa2xXZq7qK3GnqSepqRiv7a5zquqaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fimportant-question-travis-kelce-asked-taylor-swift-super-bowl-after-party-engagement-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fimportant-question-travis-kelce-asked-taylor-swift-super-bowl-after-party-engagement-rumors.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fimportant-question-travis-kelce-asked-taylor-swift-super-bowl-after-party-engagement-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fimportant-question-travis-kelce-asked-taylor-swift-super-bowl-after-party-engagement-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fimportant-question-travis-kelce-asked-taylor-swift-super-bowl-after-party-engagement-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fimportant-question-travis-kelce-asked-taylor-swift-super-bowl-after-party-engagement-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fans-react-to-ushers-ex-tameka-fosters-earnings-from-their-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fans-react-to-ushers-ex-tameka-fosters-earnings-from-their-divorce.html>Ushers Ex-Wife Reveals How Much She Earned From Their Divorce In Tell-All Memoir</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-is-preppy-in-fall-outfit-ahead-of-1989-re-release.html>Taylor Swift Is Preppy in Fall Outfit Ahead of 1989 Re-Release</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-swift-is-preppy-in-fall-outfit-ahead-of-1989-re-release.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
