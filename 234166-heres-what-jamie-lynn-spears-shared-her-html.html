I put a big gate up around it, and I was like, 'I'm going to stay here, raise my baby, and figure this out because this is real life,” Jamie told Today, now that her first child, Maddie, is 12 years old.</p><p class=dh>“I've put myself in this situation, I'm not condoning it or saying it's right, but these are the cards that I have to play. And I tried to do the best that I could," Jamie added, also sharing that she found small-town Mississippi to be the ideal place to embark on her motherhood journey.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HER OLDER SISTER</strong></p><p class=dh>Jamie also credited her older sister, Britney, who grew up as a famous entertainer before becoming a pop music icon, with not only serving as an example to her but also teaching her how to protect herself when in the spotlight.</p><p class=dh>“She taught me to protect myself. And I think that I learned how to be strong, but also keep it honest, and it was 100 percent helpful in every single way,” the mother-of-two also told Today.</p><p class=dh>As Jamie grew up, she always saw the contrast between her normal childhood and the life of her superstar big sister, who at one moment became the most famous person in the world.</p><p class=dh>While Jamie resisted the temptations to follow Britney’s steps and becoming a singer, by age 9 she knew that she was really into acting, and she stepped into the business right away.</p><p class=dh>But thanks to her sister, Jamie ended up embracing music as well, and by the time she landed her breakthrough role in “Zoey 101,” she<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/jamie-lynn-spears-zoey-101-reboot-new-music> wrote and recorded </a>the series' theme song “Follow Me” in collaboration with Britney.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TEASING A REUNION</strong></p><p class=dh>Following a long hiatus, during which she saw her firstborn become a teenager and she welcomed her second child, 2-year-old daughter Ivey Joan Watson, shared with her husband Jamie Watson, Jamie returned to the small screen with her first adult role, on the Netflix series “Sweet Magnolias,” which premiered in 2020.</p><p class=dh>But the rumors of a “Zoey 101” reboot have been insisting lately, especially since <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/jamie-lynn-spears-teases-zoey-101-cast-reunion/>the original cast</a> of the series briefly reunited in March to make a guest appearance on “All That,” aired in July.</p><p class=dh>More recently, on October 18, Jamie took to social media (both Twitter and Instagram), to share different posts that tease a proper reboot of the iconic TV series that made her, for better or worse, who she is today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqbWlma3qpsdGeqmavmJbBbrbApqCeZZyuu6950qmcmqqjYsCprdGem2aglad7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f234166-heres-what-jamie-lynn-spears-shared-her-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f234166-heres-what-jamie-lynn-spears-shared-her-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f234166-heres-what-jamie-lynn-spears-shared-her-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f234166-heres-what-jamie-lynn-spears-shared-her-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f234166-heres-what-jamie-lynn-spears-shared-her-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f234166-heres-what-jamie-lynn-spears-shared-her-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nba-youngboy-height.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nba-youngboy-height.html>NBA YoungBoy Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carlos-alcarazz-net-worth.html>Carlos Alcarazz Net Worth - KahawaTungu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carlos-alcarazz-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
