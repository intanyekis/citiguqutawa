Looking back, fans are now taking exception to just about everything he did, and that includes <a href=#>a certain interview alongside Sofia Vergara.</a></p><p>Nonetheless, it seems like Cosby and Hefner were quite the pals behind the scenes, so much so that a representative of Playboy called Cosby, Hefner's "best guy." We'll take a look at everything we know about their dark relationship.</p><h2 id=a-amp-e-39-s-39-secrets-of-playboy-39-plans-to-expose-some-of-hugh-hefner-39-s-darkest-secrets>A&E's 'Secrets Of Playboy' Plans To Expose Some Of Hugh Hefner's Darkest Secrets</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is a ten-part series- set to tackle some of the lesser-known facts that took place behind the scenes. From the looks of it, the show will exploit the darker side of the late Hugh Hefner. In the docu-series are some of his former Playmates, who really don't have the greatest stories to say about the Playboy owner.</p><p>Alongside the New York Post, <a href=#>Sondra Theodore shared a bit of her experience</a> and how troubling it all was behind the scenes.</p><p>“He was a predator. I watched him, I watched his game. And I watched a lot of girls go through [the Playboy Mansion] gates looking farm-fresh, and leaving looking tired and haggard," she told the Post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Hugh Hefner's Most Famous Girlfriend Says She Felt Brainwashed By Him, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>The series plans to reveal some extremely dark moments, especially the way Hefner treated the Playmates, and how he ran the house like a cult.</p><p>In addition, some of his lesser-known friendships will also be exposed, including one alongside a now-disgraced comedian. Turns out, the two might've been a lot closer than most realize.</p><h2 id=a-playboy-playmate-referred-to-bill-cosby-as-hugh-hefner-39-s-quot-best-guy-quot>A Playboy Playmate Referred To Bill Cosby As Hugh Hefner's "Best Guy"</h2><p>There was a lot more going on behind the scenes at the mansion, especially with Bill Cosby. In late 2014, Judy Huth filed a lawsuit against Cosby, for his treatment of her at the Playboy Mansion. This wouldn't be the only claim, as P.J. Masten would also discuss similar claims, that again took place at the mansion. Masten would further reveal that these allegations happened to several other women as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Bill Cosby Tried To Get Wendy Williams Fired From Her Radio Show</a></span></p><p>It was said that her superior told her not to say anything about the ordeal, given that Cosby held a close relationship to Hefner and that, <a href=#>"he was his guy."</a></p><p>“She said to me, ‘You know that’s Hef’s best friend, right?’” Masten recalled. “I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘Well, nobody is going to believe you. I suggest you keep your mouth shut.’”</p><p>Hefner would issue a statement regarding Cosby's allegations, choosing a politically correct statement at the time alongside CNN.</p><p>"Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two clearly had a close relationship and in fact, it would span even further. According to Tom Smothers, Hefner himself actually broke up a fight that featured Cosby at the Playboy Mansion.</p><h2 id=hugh-hefner-stepped-in-to-stop-a-fight-that-included-bill-cosby-at-his-playboy-mansion>Hugh Hefner Stepped In To Stop A Fight That Included Bill Cosby At His Playboy Mansion</h2><p>Back in the '60s, when the Smothers Brothers were popular comedic acts, they did not get along with Bill Cosby and that was especially true when it came to their political ideologies. It all escalated back in the late-'70s when Cosby had enough and struck Tom Smothers at the Playboy Mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Tom retold his interpretation of what had transpired.</a></p><p>“He hit me right in the head with his fist – knocked me down … and I was down there a minute or two and he was standing over me screaming at me, ‘C’mon, I’ll kick your ass,’ stuff like that. I’ve never seen him since then.”</p><p>Cosby's team would issue a statement as well, making mention that Tom was warned several times during the party about his behavior.</p><p>Now thankfully, the brawl did not get out of hand as Hefner was the one to come in and stop things from escalating to a worse degree.</p><p>Hefner never spoke about the brawl though, in truth, he kept a lot of things about his relationship with Bill Cosby extremely quiet. The new A&E documentary might open the door to a different side of the late man behind Playboy.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>How Did 'Harry Potter' Star Scarlett Byrne End Up Married To Hugh Hefner's Son?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScYrCwv8GyZKGtl516qbHFp5yrZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXqxuMCymaixXaKur7%2FIqKVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbill-cosby-hugh-hefner-relationship-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbill-cosby-hugh-hefner-relationship-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbill-cosby-hugh-hefner-relationship-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbill-cosby-hugh-hefner-relationship-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbill-cosby-hugh-hefner-relationship-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbill-cosby-hugh-hefner-relationship-playboy-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-moments-of-the-kelces-taylor-swift-at-chiefs-vs-bills-game.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-moments-of-the-kelces-taylor-swift-at-chiefs-vs-bills-game.html>Best Moments of the Kelces, Taylor Swift at Chiefs vs. Bills Game</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-people-are-saying-about-the-us-version-of-love-on-the-spectrum.html>Here's What Fans Are Saying About The US Version Of 'Love On The Spectrum'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-people-are-saying-about-the-us-version-of-love-on-the-spectrum.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
