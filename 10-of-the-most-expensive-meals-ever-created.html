It brings insight to a culture, the economic situation, environmental influences, or sociological behaviors. Anyone who ever has gone through a heartbreak knows the answer--grab a container of ice cream! Watching the big game? Wings, chili, and nachos better be on the table. Or if you are feeling sick, soup is the best medicine.</p><p>Food can also be the starting base for a lot of great events in your life. From everything to starting with a home-cooked family meal with the ones you&nbsp;love, a tomato food fight on the streets of Bunol, Spain, or best of all, a romantic relationship could grow over a candle lit dinner. Want to really impress that girl? Take her to one of these restaurants that are home to the world's most expensive meals and let cupid's arrow fly! Or if you are happy and single- have an over the top food fight, just be sure to invite us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=666---douche-burger>10. $666 - Douche Burger</h2><p>via:www.ozlotteries.com</p><p>What started as a joke of sorts to make fun of the over-topped burgers out there, the 666 Burger food truck in New York City created a burger to end all burgers. Once they decided to "pile all the rich people stuff on it", the <a href=#>Douche Burger</a> was born. A Kobe beef patty stuffed with foie&nbsp;gras, covered in champagne stem melted Gruyere cheese and topped with caviar, truffles,&nbsp;lobster and a BBQ sauce made with Kopi Luwak coffee beans. If you aren't familiar with Kopi Luwak coffee, they are coffee beans which have been digested&nbsp;and then pooped out by an Asian palm civet. Don't worry though, the gold leaf wrapper should distract you from that fact.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-000---zillion-dollar-lobster-frittata>9. $1,000 - Zillion Dollar Lobster Frittata</h2><p>via:www.sentientdecisionscience.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>New York, New York, the city that never sleeps. No matter if you have been to bed or not, one still needs to eat breakfast, so head down to Le Parker Meridien on uptown’s 56th street to start your morning off right! This <a href=#>gourmet&nbsp;frittata</a> is made with 10 ounces of exclusive sefruga caviar (which costs $65 per ounce), 6 eggs, an entire lobster, chives and cream. If you aren't in the mood for dishing out $1,000 first thing in the morning, a slimmed-down version&nbsp;for $100 is available. After all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day!</p><p></p><h2 id=1-980---sushi-del-oriente>8. $1,980 -&nbsp;Sushi del Oriente</h2><p>via:imgur.com</p><p>No, this is certainly not your typical $3 California roll! Chef Angelito Araneta Jr., nicknamed the suiting “Karat Chef”, introduced this <a href=#>incredible sushi</a> to the world. In 2010, Sushi del Oriente was the highlight at a restaurant in Milan, but it was not for sale. The sushi roll includes wild saffron, foie&nbsp;gras (a delicacy banned in many nations) and sea cucumber. Topped with 12 Palawan pearls, four 0.2 karat diamonds and wrapped in gold leaf. Many of Chef Angelito's creations are purchased as wedding or proposal gifts, which would make sense as to why this is a roll best admired and not digested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-200---pizza-royale-007>7. $4,200 -&nbsp;Pizza Royale 007</h2><p>via:twitter.com</p><p>Pizza is a staple in most people's life, but we are guessing not this one. Chef Domenico Crolla created the 12-inch pizza for the purpose to auction it off on eBay with proceeds going to The Fred Hollows Foundation. Just some of the toppings are&nbsp;lobster marinated in cognac, sun-blush tomato sauce,&nbsp;Scottish smoked salmon, caviar soaked in champagne, prosciutto, venison medallions, vintage balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with 24-carat gold flakes that are edible. Once put on eBay,&nbsp;Italian lawyer Maurizio Morelli had the winning bid at £2,150 (approx. $4,200 in US dollars). So tough luck, you won't be able to purchase this pizza.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-000---anqi-pho-soup>6. $5,000 - AnQi Pho Soup</h2><p>via:www.theculinaryscoop.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nothing like a bowl of soup on a rainy day, right? Does that rain have you feeling a bit (okay, a lot) fancy today? Just head to Santa Monica’s Tiato restaurant, home of the $5,000 pho soup. Made with Wagyu beef, noodles from a rare blue lobster meat,&nbsp;foie gras broth, and white Alba truffles, the restaurant needs a 7-day lead time just to prepare. The soup was auctioned off at the Bash Benefactor Dinner on May 13, 2011. The money raised went to&nbsp;the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospitals of Los Angeles and Orange County. Who knew a bowl of soup could do so much good?</p><p></p><h2 id=7000---pink-bite-burger>5. $7000 - "Pink Bite" Burger</h2><p>via www.arabiangazette.com</p><p>Another meal created to raise money for a good cause, the Pink Bike burger was cooked up by Pink Caravan at Galleries Lafayette in Dubai Mall, just last month. It shattered the record for <a href=#>most expensive</a> burger ever sold at AED 25,960 ($7,000 US). The Pink Caravan ambassadors, whose work is to draw attention to breast cancer, were divided into three teams. Shaikh Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Thani, Chairman of the Department of Statistics and Community Development in Sharjah, lead his team to victory with the help of his sons, Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Sultan. Each team's burger was auctioned off, the winning team's at $7,000, followed by $3,540 and $3,175. The fact that this burger isn't loaded with the same high-end ingredients as some of the others&nbsp;makes it all the more impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-500---fortress-stilt-fisherman-indulgence>4. $14,500 - Fortress Stilt Fisherman Indulgence</h2><p>via:www.amazingandweird.com</p><p>You might as well skip dinner and head straight for dessert. DUO restaurant at the Fortress Resort & Spa in Sri Lanka is home to the decadent dessert described on Fortress' website as "first-class delicacy is perfect for those who crave the thrill and satisfaction that an ordinary dessert simply cannot deliver". Served in a dish adorned with an 80 karat Aquamarine stone, this gold leaf Italian cassata, with mango and pomegranate compote and Irish cream infused fruit, is topped with Dom Perignon champagne sabayon. To finish, a handmade chocolate carving in the shape of a stilt fisherman holding onto his stilts stands next to it. Indulgence doesn't even begin to describe this dessert!</p><p></p><h2 id=25-000---the-frrrozen-haute-chocolate-ice-cream>3. $25,000 - The Frrrozen Haute Chocolate Ice Cream</h2><p>via:observer.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once holding the&nbsp;Guinness World Record for the most expensive dessert,&nbsp;Serendipity 3, along with luxury jeweler Euphoria New York, teamed up to create a chocoholic's dream. Made with 28 cocoas, which 14 of those are the world's most expensive and exotic. The ice cream is infused with 5 grams of 23-karat gold and dished up in a goblet lined with edible gold. Around the goblet is an 18-karat gold bracelet&nbsp;decorated with 1-carat white diamonds. This masterpiece is topped with gold covered whipped cream and a La Madeline au Truffle from Knipschildt Chocolatier ($2,600 a pound). To eat the ice cream, a gold spoon which is decorated with white and chocolate-colored diamonds (that took three months to design) is presented. So hey, at least you have something to show for all that money you spent.</p><p></p><h2 id=34-531---pudding>2. $34,531 - Pudding</h2><p>via:news.softpedia.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Go ahead, you're an adult, eat your dessert before your supper. Lindeth Howe Country House Hotel (once owned by children's author Beatrix Potter) lies in England's picturesque Lake District. They have created a chocolate pudding that costs £22,000 ($34,531).&nbsp;Chef Marc Guibert's masterpiece is designed to look like a Faberge egg. The <a href=#>top-notch</a> chocolate pudding is adorned in a gold leaf, champagne, caviar and a 2 karat diamond (because why not?). Laced with edible gold, and layered with champagne jelly, it&nbsp;is so pretty you might not want to eat it. Nah! Just don't forget to order this pudding two weeks in advance!</p><p></p><h2 id=3-95-million---strawberries-arnaud>1. $3.95 million - Strawberries Arnaud</h2><p>via:www.eonline.com</p><p>Arnaud's in New Orleans was once home to a $1.4 million dessert, but why keep that on the menu when you have created something bigger and better. After co-owner Katy Casbarian&nbsp;partnered with MS Rau antiques to create a proposal package, the&nbsp;Strawberries Arnaud was born. The dessert is made up of strawberries served in a marinade of spices, citrus, red wine and port with vanilla ice cream. However, those strawberries aren't what jacks up the price; a 7.09 karat&nbsp;pink diamond is provided because, after all, this is a proposal package. So, we are guessing that&nbsp;if you are going to purchase this dessert, you want to be sure she is going to say yes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>reuters.com</a>, <a href=#>emirates247.com</a>, <a href=#>digitaljournal.com</a>, <a href=#>bbc.com</a>, <a href=#>bloomberg.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKieXam1pnnMqKqtZZWtvaa60qKtnmWdmq6tv4yerZ6qXZi%2Fpq3Tnpto</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-of-the-most-expensive-meals-ever-created.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-of-the-most-expensive-meals-ever-created.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-of-the-most-expensive-meals-ever-created.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-of-the-most-expensive-meals-ever-created.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-of-the-most-expensive-meals-ever-created.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-of-the-most-expensive-meals-ever-created.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./antonietta-gonzalez-collins-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-653637-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./antonietta-gonzalez-collins-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-653637-html.html>Antonietta Gonzalez-Collins Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zach-bryan-brianna-lapaglia-make-red-carpet-debut-at-2024-grammys.html>Zach Bryan, Brianna LaPaglia Make Red Carpet Debut at 2024 Grammys</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zach-bryan-brianna-lapaglia-make-red-carpet-debut-at-2024-grammys.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
