They could have at least said the suit is ‘unisex,’ but they didn’t because it’s about erasing women. Ever wondered why we hardly see this go the other way?”</p><p>In another reply, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a user tweeted</a>: “I have breasts, hips and no need for an extra pouch of fabric around my labia. I guess that means this bathing suit isn’t for me.. or most women. In which other instance do companies advertise to a demographic of ~1%? Women make up ~50% and we’re struggling lol! Make it make sense.”</p><p>The same user, who goes by June on the site, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">later responded</a> that she “can accept” Adidas not wanting “real women as a customer,” but instead urged the brand to “sell it in an LGBT category” rather than marketing it as a women’s bathing suit.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">An outspoken Twitter user, who goes by “June” on the site, slammed Adidas for marketing the swimsuit to women, and later replied that it should be “in an LGBT category.” <span class=credit>June_Can_Do_It/Twitter</span></figure><p>The swimsuit isn’t the only clothing item in Adidas’ new Pride line labeled under “Women’s,” but seemingly modeled by males.</p><p>Women’s dresses, T-shirts, shorts and soccer jerseys touting “Love Wins” are also seen online being worn by models who appeared to be male.</p><p>Only the women’s plus-size clothing was shown on a model who appeared female.</p><p>“Maybe Adidas does not appreciate large trans models or skinny female models,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one user pointed out</a> on Twitter.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Others cited </a>the catchphrase, “Go woke, go broke,” which has gained traction since brands like Bud Light and Nike tapped trans social media star Dylan Mulvaney for partnerships, which ultimately led to boycotts and profit losses.</p><p>Last month, <a href=#>Adidas rival Nike tapped Mulvaney for a brand deal</a> to promote the company’s apparel.</p><p>Mulvaney revealed the partnership in a series of Instagram Story posts wearing Nike’s activewear, including pants and a sports bra.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The swimsuit isn’t the only clothing item in Adidas’ new Pride line labeled under “Women’s” that is seemingly modeled by a male. <span class=credit>Adidas</span></figure><p>“Alert the media — I’m entering my workout era,” Mulvaney, a transgender woman, wrote in a caption for her 2 million followers to see.</p><p>Nike faced outrage over its decision to have Mulvaney promote women’s apparel, and a <a href=#>“Burn Bra Challenge” ensued on TikTok</a>.</p><p>“I’m running out of brands to wear,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another tweeted</a>, while yet another said they wouldn’t be buying from Adidas again. “On to another brand that respects women,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the user wrote</a>.</p><p class=postsid
