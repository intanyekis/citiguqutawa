While he won't be around fellow drivers anymore, he still has a beautiful wife at home.</p><p class=Fg>In April, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/20/kyle-larson-nascar-asian-japanese-american-playoffs>Kyle Larson</a> got himself suspended from Nascar and his team, Chip Ganassi Racing, indefinitely. Currently, he's unable to use his passion to provide for his wife and two children.</p><p class=Fg>Larson, a Japanese-American, is not someone one might have expected to be in this position. As for his wife, she's still by his side. Let's learn more about her.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>HER BROTHER IS A RACER</strong></p><p class=Fg>Larson, 27, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/news/2020/04/katelyn-sweet-kyle-larson-wife/>met</a> his wife Katelyn Sweet in the mid-2010s. Sweet was already familiar with professional racing because her brother, Brad is a former Nascar and World of Outlaw sprint driver.</p><p class=Fg>These days, the racer is number 49 for Kasey Kahne Racing. His record includes wins at the Knoxville Midget Nationals, the Belleville Midget Nationals, and the Sprint Car and Midget Four Crown Nationals.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>SHE'S AN ATHLETE</strong></p><p class=Fg>For her part, Sweet stays healthy as a runner by doing marathons. When she was younger, she was an equestrian for six years. She sometimes shares throwback photos from her horse-riding days.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>SHE HAS TWO KIDS WITH KYLE</strong></p><p class=Fg>Before Larson and Sweet tied the knot, the pair welcomed two adorable tots. Owen Miyata was born in December 2014. Four years later, in 2018, his younger sister, Audrey Layne, joined him.</p><p class=Fg>Like most racers, Larson's career was turned into a family affair as his wife and kids would often attend events. For off-track photos, one can refer to Sweet's Instagram page where cute pictures abound.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THEY TIED THE KNOT IN 2018</strong></p><p class=Fg>A few months after Sweet gave birth to Audrey, she and Larson tied the knot with a traditional wedding. They've been together since September of 2018.</p><p class=Fg>The pair seem to still be going strong despite recent happenings. Of course, Larson's career might not be conclusively over. Now that he's not tied down with Nascar, he has other options.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>LARSON MAY STILL DRIVE</strong></p><p class=Fg>One of them is <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2020/06/15/kyle-larson-brad-sweet-donny-schatz-logan-schuchart-steve-kinser-world-of-outlaws-sprint-cars-dirt-racing/?fbclid=IwAR05G3VC3maV2GU3lfnVcinEJksL-zkvCmpXzmjIR4Nns9kRowAQIVR1eyE">to join</a> the World of Outlaws tour, which he'd been interested in for a couple of years.

In addition to the dark side he displayed, he's typically goofy and knows how to laugh at himself.</p><p class=Fg>The multi-racial driver <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.kylelarsonracing.com/>hails</a> from northern California and has left a series of successes in his wake thus far. He's been an entrepreneur and owns his own home, but his children are undoubtedly his greatest achievement.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>BUBBA WALLACE STANDS OUT</strong></p><p class=Fg>Elsewhere, the first African-American full-time Nascar driver, Darrell Bubba Wallace, is <a class="Xd a" href=#>doing his part</a> to curb such racist outpouring both in the sport and outside of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e5f9b3e5453019aeafeaca4f778086e4.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Race car driver Bubba Wallace before qualifying for the NASCAR Cup Series Auto Club 400 at Auto Club Speedway in February 2020. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Not only is he pushing for change, but he shared the story of a cousin of his who also died at the hands of a police officer.
