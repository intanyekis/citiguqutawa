it topped the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> box office charts</a>.</p><p>Five Nights At Freddy's dropped to second place with $9 million in its third weekend, while Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour added another $5.9 million in its fifth weekend.</p><p>Sofia Coppola's Priscilla Presley biopic Priscilla remained in fourth with $4.79 million, and Martin Scorsese's Killers Of The Flower Moon landed in fifth with $4.6 million in its fourth week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's been a mixed bag for new releases this year, with some films performing well and others struggling.</p><p>The Marvels is the latest example of a highly anticipated film which failed to meet expectations – and it will be interesting to see how it performs in the coming weeks, and whether audiences will flock to theaters at a more leisurely pace.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/richest-mcu-actors.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>From Superheroes To Millionaires: Ranking The Richest MCU Stars</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Marvel Studios' allure to top-tier actors is undeniable.
