With the varied characters and timeline that covers several decades, the series showcases phenomenal fashion statements.Despite the finest fashion on the show, one actor seems to hate his overall look. The 46-year-old Irish actor Cillian Murphy revealed his disapproval on his haircut on the show.

The crime series is widely known for its remarkable well-dressed characters that creative a massive following. Peaky Blinders is such a great show and loved by the fans that they even wanted to imitate the 1920s getup from the show including the hairstyle of the casts.</p><p>But as it turns out, the star Peaky Blinders himself, <a href=#>Cillian Murphy playing as Tommy Shelby</a>, hates his trademark haircut on the show. The actor who has been playing the role since 2013 reveals his dislike towards his famous haircut. He does not particularly hate it, but he’s just used to having a long hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did 'Peaky Blinders' Have A Bad Final Season?">Did 'Peaky Blinders' Have A Bad Final Season?</a></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans apparently love the haircut </a>and Murphy is surprised that everyone seems to have developed a thing for it. During his 2017 interview, he tells Shortlist “But people like the undercut thing; people go to the barber and ask for a ‘Peaky cut’. It’s crazy that people like it, it’s not grown on me in four years now. I normally keep my hair long.”</p><p>He continued "Do realize the people in turtlenecks in Hackney with this haircut, do they realize it was styled this way to prevent lice?

The team pretty much based the costume of the series on the criminal mug shots from the early 20th century.</p><p>Costume designer Stephanie Collie tells Esquire “You could see everything in so much detail: the cufflinks, the tie-pins, the textures." She believes that the reason the costume on the show was a great hit among the fans was because every Englishman unconsciously wanted to wear a suit.
