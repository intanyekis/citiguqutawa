For example, in years past a lot of parents have let their kids watch <a href=#>the best Disney animated movies</a>, and in some cases, they have watched right beside them. On top of that, even though <a href=#>Sesame Street has been involved in some controversies</a>, the brand has remained a consistent part of children’s television. It also has to be noted that Barney the Purple Dinosaur was so popular in the past that <a href=#>the actors who played the character became rich</a>.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Was The Biggest Controversy Surrounding ‘Barney And Friends’</a></span>In recent years, there has been a new children’s entertainer who has risen to great fame and success, Blippi. First introduced to kids on YouTube, the character Blippi has become extremely successful as more and more parents let their kids watch his antics. As it turns out, however, there is a video starring the person who portrays Blippi that is likely to shock his character’s fans and their parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-video-that-will-shock-blippi-fans>The Video That Will Shock Blippi Fans</h2><p>From the outside looking in, it certainly seems like creating content that is directed at kids shouldn’t be too difficult. After all, adults often think that kids are easy to please as long as they have something colorful and loud to watch. In reality, however, history reveals that it is very easy for people behind the most popular children’s entertainment brands to not realize they are crossing the line. When it comes to the shocking video which starred the man who is famous for being Blippi, it goes so far over the line that it is mindblowing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sesame Street Episode That Got Banned From TV For Being 'Too Frightening'</a></span></p><p>Before Stevin John became rich and famous for creating and portraying the character Blippi, he decided to embrace a popular internet trend, the Harlem Shake. At the height of the Harlem Shake’s popularity, it seemed like virtually everyone was making their own version of the video trend. After all, it wasn’t hard for people to recreate one person dancing alone suddenly being joined by a bunch of people going nuts once the beat dropped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Likely because he wanted to stand out from the crowd, when Stevin John made his own Harlem Shake video, he took things in a very different and shocking direction. At the time, John had created a character for himself named Steezy Grossman. While in character as Grossman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John produced his version of the Harlem Shake</a> that was so out there that it is hard to describe in a safe for work way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Stevin Johns’ video titled “Harlem Shake P**p”, Steezy Grossman can be seen sitting on a toilet in the opening part of the song. With his pants down, Grossman wears sunglasses, a tank top, and a bicycle helmet as he rolls his arms to the song. Instead of being joined by other people when the beat drops, the video then cuts to Grossman standing on the toilet lid sideways without any clothes on.</p><p>While Blippi fans and their parents would be shocked enough to know that Stevin John once published a video of himself with nothing on, things get a lot worse from there. When the beat drops in the video, another person can be seen in the room and they are doing a headstand against a wall while they are completely undressed. A few seconds after the beat drops, Steezy Grossman suddenly has a bowel movement onto the second person in the room. As the video ends, Grossman giggles and both men dance even as the other person begins to gag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-actor-behind-blippi-has-tried-to-erase-the-video-from-existence>The Actor Behind Blippi Has Tried To Erase The Video From Existence</h2><p>Once Stevin John became a children’s entertainer, the aforementioned video became a huge liability for him. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that John deleted the video. However, anyone familiar with the internet should know that if something appears online, it becomes nearly impossible to erase it from history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Barney And Friends' Could Have Been Canceled For These Shocking Reasons</a></span></p><p>Despite Stevin John’s attempts to make people forget his Harlem Shake video, Buzzfeed News got their hands on the clip and published an article about it. Once Buzzfeed reached out to Blippi’s representatives, they were given <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a cease and desist letter</a> to make sure they didn’t actually publish the video as a part of their article. On top of that, John provided Buzzfeed News with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement about the video</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Yes, I did make a gross-out comedy video when I was in my early twenties, long before I started Blippi. At the time, I thought this sort of thing was funny, but really it was stupid and tasteless, and I regret having ever done it. "I've grown up a lot since then, and I trust people will see me as the person I am now, not the idiot I was back then."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBursuip6mhXau2pbHOZqqcmZ6Zrq17</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-blippi-video-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-blippi-video-scandal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-blippi-video-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-blippi-video-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-blippi-video-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-blippi-video-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-get-rid-of-hiccups.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-get-rid-of-hiccups.html>13 Proven Ways To Get Rid Of Hiccups</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pauly-d-ranked-one-worlds-highest-paid-djs-106693.html>Pauly D Ranked One of the Worlds Highest Paid DJs!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pauly-d-ranked-one-worlds-highest-paid-djs-106693.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
