In 2001, following the release of Mariah Carey's film, Glitter, the movie went on to become a major flop, leaving it as one project Mimi wishes she never did.</p><p>While she has since grown to love the film and its soundtrack, fans are curious as to why it didn't do well in the first place, considering it was released during Mariah's peak. So, what really happened with Glitter? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mariah Carey Has Been Friends With Jay Z For Ever, But Are They Still Close?</a></span></p><h2 id=glitter-flopped>'Glitter' Flopped</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes announced the Mariah Carey would be taking on the role of Billie Frank in the film, Glitter, fans couldn't wait to witness her vocals and acting performance on-screen.</p><p>Mariah has taken on an array of on-screen roles throughout her career. Mariah took on lead roles in Wise Girls, and Tennessee, all while scoring smaller parts in Lee Daniels, The Butler, and Precious.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the hype surrounding the film, which would mark Mariah's first time as a lead in her own movie, it appears as if it let fans down big time. While the movie went on to become a massive flop, as it's described, it wasn't due to the film itself, but rather the unfortunate timing of its release.</p><p>Glitter premiered back in 2001, and despite having massive names attached to the film, including Mariah Carey, Da Brat, Terrence Howard, and Padma Lakshmi, it went on to become a total letdown, grossing over $5 million worldwide with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$22 million estimated budget</a>. Yikes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film, which was produced by 20th Century Fox, worked in collaboration with Sony Pictures and Columbia, both companies Mariah's ex-husband, Tommy Mottola had a lot of power in.</p><p>Considering Mimi divorced Tommy following the movie and soundtrack deal, the singer claims this gave the Sony exec more than enough time to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"sabotage" the movie.</a></p><p>Mariah Carey went on to reveal that the film itself didn't even have a proper script, which should have been a red flag from the get-go. As if Tommy's alleged role in production delays and script issues weren't enough, the movie could not have come at a worse time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After its premiere on September 21, 2001, the film didn't stand a chance at doing big in the box office following the events that transpired in New York City only a week before! It goes without saying that the devastating attack on 9/11 stunned the entire country, making it clear that film numbers wouldn't be all that great, which Mariah has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mentioned</a> before.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mariah Carey's Biggest Diva Moments</a></span></p><h2 id=justice-for-glitter>Justice For 'Glitter'</h2><p>Although the film found itself mocked and critically reviewed due to its lack of depth, and less than stellar acting work, which led Mariah to keep hush about the film for most of her career afterward.</p><p>Despite feeling embarrassed and let down, Mariah Carey had one aspect of the movie to be proud of, and that was the soundtrack!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariah brought back the '80s before it was even popular, proving herself to be a genre genius before her time, with new wave dance-pop having made a major comeback since Mariah's take on it back in the early 2000s.</p><p>Mariah's lead single 'Loverboy', which came out months prior to the film, landed at the number two spot on the Billboard Hot 100, creating a lot of talk surrounding the movie and the album.</p><p>Although the soundtrack was reportedly sabotaged too, it didn't manage to soar to #1 the way fans expected, however, 18 years following its release, it did just that!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitter went to number one</a> across the globe, sparking the hashtag #JusticeForGlitter. It was around this time that Mariah stopped looking back on the film and its soundtrack with disdain and owned it knowing just how much her fan base loves it.</p><p>Luckily for Mimi, Glitter has since become available on all streaming apps, which has only allowed a brand new audience to discover how sensational the album is, even if the film wasn't all that great!</p><p>During Mariah's most recent tour, The Caution Tour, she included a Glitter moment in the set, which the songstress did for the very first time, ever! Now, with the soundtrack finally being recognized as the masterpiece as it is, it's safe to say Mariah has nothing to worry about when it comes to Glitter anymore.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mariah Carey & 9 Other Singers Who Can Hit A Whistle Note</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZqSaqpmWtW6vwKucsqtdory3tcRmnqWhpKmys3nFpaapqJWZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-reason-why-mariah-careys-movie-glitter-flopped.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-real-reason-why-mariah-careys-movie-glitter-flopped.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-mariah-careys-movie-glitter-flopped.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-real-reason-why-mariah-careys-movie-glitter-flopped.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-mariah-careys-movie-glitter-flopped.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-why-mariah-careys-movie-glitter-flopped.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2-chainz-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2-chainz-net-worth.html>2 Chainz Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hair-styling-sale-5130054.html>Save Up To 50% On Hair Styling Tools Just Before Prime Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hair-styling-sale-5130054.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
