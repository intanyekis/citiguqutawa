A good actor but GV Lucky was a family man first. With Lucky talking all that stuff about being there for Liz kids I'm sorry I have not seen him much with Liz children.</p><p>I'm glad if the rumors are true they are testing him with a new girl at least Liz do not have to be bother with maxie thank you GH. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> I just don't think this Lucky is a family man…I do not see it. :~</p><p>Gv where ever u are I miss you!!! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I miss him so much.

I'm just not attracted to him. *) I think GV was awesome with Cam. I wish he could come back as a doctor or hot spy.</p><p>That would be cool and he come to be Liz love interest or sam. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I like JJ but I do miss GV. He is way hot and sweet. I always thought it was funny that his mother is a romance novelist and he looks like he walked right out of a romance novel! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I believe he is now on the new Beverly Hills 90210 If you're looking for him.</p><p>I miss GV as well. JJ is nailing his parts with Luke, but for me he's just too weepy with all the rest of it.</p><p>Oh I miss GV!! and GV with the boys was the sweetest scenes always. I think the directors saw what we all saw when he was with them and used them whenever possible.</p><p>I am enjoying JJ's Lucky, because I am a huge Lucky fan and very happy to see that he is finally becoming the character he should be. For whatever reason, when GV was Lucky, it was not happening… so as much as I miss GV, I so happy to see the character of Lucky receiving the writing the character deserves.</p><p>I am a fan of all… Lucky! GV! and JJ!</p><p>Oh I miss GV!! and GV with the boys was the sweetest scenes always.

For whatever reason, when GV was Lucky, it was not happening… so as much as I miss GV, I so happy to see the character of Lucky receiving the writing the character deserves.</p><p>I am a fan of all… Lucky! GV! and JJ!</p><p>i never really found GV to be believable as Lucky, I didn't find that he had a characteristic's or similarity's to luke and laura. I am extremely happy that JJ is reprising the role of lucky, and i even find it believable that he could be semi-related to ethan and luke, and lulu. I only felt that his only resemblence to the cast was to nikolas, and htat was only becasue they were both built. It's not that i have anything against GV he is a talented actor and very handsome, i just never thought that he fit the part of lucky, I would be more than happy if he came back as a different character.</p><p>I miss him with Liz kids Gv Lucky…Lucky(JJ) just don't seem real as far as the kids are concern…he speaks of his joy for the kids but action speaks louder than words ever will. It is doing things like Nic did today. Don't like Nic though is it me or was he annoyed today Nic…who ask him to bring the children by. No to Niz ever!!! Don't want to see them together ever. I think Jason was annoyed with Lucky too today he's probably tired of his whining all the time.</p><p>Something is up with Lucky (JJ) I don't think he wants to be the father to Liz children at all. Poor baby that is coming he do not even want him or her. The more I see this version of Lucky I'm not liking he reminds me of AJ in way I did not like AJ. This Lucky has a lot of growing up to do till he do that I do not see him being a dad to Liz children or LL2 child I just don't see it…I think Jason sense it too. He is annoyed with Lucky and probably tired of him complaining.</p><p>I thought I would like this Lucky back but he has proven to not be the Lucky I fell in love with as a teenager.<br>I just hope Liz stay true to what she wants that is her children & the baby to be. She is a good single Mother. Go Liz! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sure this Lucky is good being a cop & a son to Luke their bond together but he has yet to show that he can be a good dad or a father to be to the child Liz carrying if it's his.<br>He talks a lot of crap and Jason knows this. For all the people that want Lucky in a relationship that is yet to be seen too…he has his moments but I want to see more than moments here and there to see. He just may not be the romantic type actor. :~ I know he will never be GV Lucky that is what I miss the most him bonding with the children. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I'm loving JJ as Lucky…</p><p>But I do miss looking a GV very much… man was he adorable <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png title=:slight_smile: alt=:slight_smile: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I'm glad some miss him as much as I do. He may of pouted too much or be mad a lot but he had heart. He would have forgiven Liz and would took the boys to see her yesterday.<br>This Lucky have issues and it involve the children sorry to say. Glad Jason was annoyed with him yesterday it showed. Go Jason! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I don't want Liz with this Lucky for those reasons. He thinks too much about his job and too little about cake. Liz needs someone that is going to be there for her & the kids this Lucky is not it. I too hope GV comes back & be a love interest for Liz or sam. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Go GV!!! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I do miss GV's hotness *) , but other than that… JJ rocks my world! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> His talent is unsurpassed on this show IMO.</p><p>As for what GV's Lucky would do vs. JJ's Lucky… I think that has more to do with the writing than the actor playing the role. :~</p><p>I miss GV's Lucky. He was a grown up Lucky. Sorry, JJ fans…but JJ's Lucky reminds me of an even whinier Luke Skywalker. Just makes me want to smack the tears right out of him. sheesh…</p><p>Besides…GV is a whole lot of purty…insert dreamy sigh</p><p>GV was never believable because he was way too old to be Lucky. He was like 10 years older than jj.</p><p>I not only like JJ (Even though I didn't think I would), but am so glad not to hear the word she or he behind everyones name. I don't know why anyone, whether it be a writer or actor would consistantly say "Elizabeth, she", or Lulu she, etc. It irriated me. If JJ is doing it, I haven't noticed it. I really like him, dispite the fact I was disapointed when I heard of the change.</p><p>I totally agree. I know he is far more handsome and I also think the better actor.</p><p>We wish you well!!!</p><p>I miss you GV. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Come back and be Liz new love interest. The last scene that these two shared loved it…everyone one was at the house celebrating their engagement love that scene. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>GV Lucky had chemistry with Leslie. So many good memories of Leslie and GV Lucky & Liz. I remember when she helped them before their second wedding.<br>Where is Leslie…I miss her too. I wonder why JJ Lucky has not had any scenes with her or Bobbie. :~</p><p>I miss the family moments that GV Lucky brought to his character he had with Liz, Leslie, Bobbie, Lulu, Nic, Cake, Em, Luke and Laura.</p><p>Gone are the special family moments…I miss them. ;(<br>I miss you GV Lucky oh yes I dooooooooooooo!!! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png title=:smiley: alt=:smiley: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> ;(</p><p>Boy I can imagine GV Lucky playing the part and he found out that the baby was his…what a special family moment that would be. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> GO LIZ & GV LUCKY!!! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I can only listen to so much of this crap, before I start to lose it…They have been trying to get JJ back for years, right under the nose of all the mediocre actors that were keeping the seat warm for him…Im sick of this idea that we can't watch a soap unless we have all the portrayors be shirtless pinups…that beefcakey mentality went out with powdered wigs…I think JJ is gorgeous, and IM a GUY!!! Straight guy!! lol…his performance is soulful, full of nuance…and oh yeah…continuity since the very first words "LUcky Spencer" spoke, came out of his mouth…you people are lucky to have him…let GV guest star as the "hunk of the week" on some low rating tween show…i could care less about him…and as far as Lucky and his kids…he's been great with them when they show them…btui how often is that? if they don't write it in, how can we say he's not afamily man…? isn't that the fault of the writers…? oy vey…</p><p>I like GV he can come back as another person they do it all the time in soaps. Lucky JJ is nice looking I never said he was not only speaking for myself. I don't see why he can not come back as another character. I just wish the writers would have JJ Lucky in more scenes with cake and Leslie & Bobbie because after all Bobbie and Lucky were always close Gh forgets the history of the Spencers. You are right a lot of things are the writers fault. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Gh needs to stop it and remember the history of their characters. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Oh and for the record I like both Luckys. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png title=:wink: alt=:wink: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvIZqSiq6NitLd5y66apLFdo7xursCsn56qo2K9rbHArJxoa2BmfnN8nqmYoJ1tZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-miss-gv-lucky-no-bashers-please.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-miss-gv-lucky-no-bashers-please.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-miss-gv-lucky-no-bashers-please.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-miss-gv-lucky-no-bashers-please.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-miss-gv-lucky-no-bashers-please.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-miss-gv-lucky-no-bashers-please.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kishori-shahane-vij-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-329290-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kishori-shahane-vij-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-329290-html.html>Kishori Shahane Vij Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./george-michael-gankas.html>George Michael Gankas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./george-michael-gankas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
