The second installment of the winter edition, this season was not shy when it came to the drama department. While some of the tension was squashed in the villa, it seems some relationships - platonic or otherwise - took a turn for the worse after the cameras went dark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an exclusive interview, TheThings spoke with fan favorite, Tanyel Revan, about her recent fall out with fellow islander, Olivia Hawkins.</p><h2 id=who-were-tanyel-39-s-closest-mates-in-the-villa>Who Were Tanyel's Closest Mates in the Villa?</h2><p>During her time on Love Islander, Tanyel emphasized the importance of transparency, making fast and strong friends with a number of her fellow islanders. Revered as a girls' girl, Tanyel's loyalties were made quite plain throughout her time in the villa as she stuck by her besties through smooth and rough sailing.</p><p>So, who were the lucky few who Tanyel trusted with her vulnerability?</p><p>"I can only go by who treated me with respect, Lana is my number onne. I think she’ll be in my life for a very, very long time. She has a pure innocent soul and she’s so caring. Sammie really, really protected me. Anything someone said she always defended me, so if someone was talking about me behind my back she was there to defend me. Zara has - especially coming out - endlessly defended me, and she really is a loyal friend... I can tell she’s very similar to me in the sense that she’s defensive over her friends. I like to be around people I trust, if someone hurts them, they’re hurting me. Male-wise I would say Ron and Harris."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Happened To Chloe Veitch and Shayne Jensen After 'Perfect Match'? We've Got The Scoop</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-tanyel-and-liv>What Happened Between Tanyel and Liv?</h2><p>The girls of Season 9 proved to be a tight group, getting candid with one another about their feelings and forming relationships that would undoubtedly survive in the real world. While many of the ladies took it upon themselves to put their friendships first, others were not so keen.</p><p>Throughout her time in the villa, Olivia (Liv) found herself in the middle of drama constantly. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Whether feuding with Zara Deniz Lackenby-Brown</a> over finalist, Tom Clare, or speaking poorly of others without their knowledge, Olivia provided the theatrics for the majority of the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tanyel tells us that she and Liv were once good friends at the onset with mutual love shared between them, Tanyel admits that she was privy to conversations Liv was having behind her back.</p><p>"People would come to me and say, "she's saying this about you." I confronted her and asked if she had a problem with me, and she would almost try to make me second guess myself, saying, "I just don't want you to look bad"... When I saw there were a few occasions where she tried to talk about me or paint me in a bad light, I thought, 'why didn't you tell me when I pulled you for these chats?' So, that's where I'm disappointed."</p><p>Even when given the opportunity to right her wrongs, Olivia chose the low road, continuing to bad mouth her supposed friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Truth About Connor Trott’s Complicated Dating Life After Love Island</a></span></p><h2 id=where-do-liv-and-tanyel-stand-now>Where Do Liv and Tanyel Stand Now?</h2><p>During the season reunion, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tanyel raised concerns about Olivia, Shaq Muhammad, and Tanya Manhenga conspiring against her to have her dumped</a>. Given she holds no malice toward Shaq and Tanya, culpability fell on Olivia's shoulders. However, little closure was given as the subsequent minimal conversation was glossed over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was hoping to maybe speak to her at the reunion. I addressed the situation when they asked me a question, she didn’t say anything back. She said she had a lot to say after, but she still hasn’t."</p><p>So, as it stands, there is little hope for restoration of Liv and Tanyel's friendship. While the two have jabbed one another through TikTok, Tanyel has opted for continued self-betterment, saying,</p><p>"I’m not here to slate her, I want people to understand I mentioned one thing at the reunion because that was all I had time for. The reason was based on multiple times when she wasn’t following girl code. She’s picked at anything after to paint me in a bad light, the things she’s saying I said to her is not true. She doesn’t hold accountability, on a podcast she said... me and Zara are digging at her... She’s always said something to me first... I’ve never started something, I’m not a bully, I’m not a mean girl, I’m a girls' girl... I want people to know I didn’t instigate... I wish her the best, I’ve only ever reacted to things she’s done or said about me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We love a self-aware queen who, despite having been wronged, still offers support of those who have done the wronging!</p><h2 id=tanyel-39-s-current-relationship-status>Tanyel's Current Relationship Status</h2><p>Although Tanyel left the villa without a man by her side, it seems things are looking up for the 26-year-old in love department. While her new beau's identity remains a secret, Tanyel gushed about the relationship she's formed with her current partner.</p><p>"He literally supports me with a lot in the sense that I like someone who supports me career-wise...he’ll sit down with me and help me with anything I need, that’s so important in your partner. He’s very generous and so am I, very giving, he’s handsome... The most important thing about it is he’s my best friend, we get along really well, and he’s very respectful."</p><p>Sorry boys, this bird is officially taken!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>'Love Is Blind' Season 4: Which Couples Are Going To Make It?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYra0uMCnm2atm2KwsLrTnqqtmZ6pwG7AwKewnqRdp7K3rc1mpqWhpp6ubrTAsKKipqNiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-island-uk-contestants-tanyel-revan-olivia-hawkins-relationship-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flove-island-uk-contestants-tanyel-revan-olivia-hawkins-relationship-interview.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flove-island-uk-contestants-tanyel-revan-olivia-hawkins-relationship-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flove-island-uk-contestants-tanyel-revan-olivia-hawkins-relationship-interview.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-island-uk-contestants-tanyel-revan-olivia-hawkins-relationship-interview.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-island-uk-contestants-tanyel-revan-olivia-hawkins-relationship-interview.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aap-rocky-talks-about-his-influence-hip-hop-141203.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aap-rocky-talks-about-his-influence-hip-hop-141203.html>A$AP Rocky Talks About His Influence on Hip-Hop</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stuart-scott-net-worth.html>Stuart Scott Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stuart-scott-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
