The extravagant mansions they own and the <a href=#>expensive cars</a> they purchase become a matter of discussion for folks worldwide. However, Billie Eilish's story is slightly different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This American songwriter and performer have often come across as quirky to the media. She is <a href=#>an inspirational figure to the young generation</a>. She got her big break when her song, Ocean Eyes, became a major hit on Soundcloud. Currently, Billie Eilish has a net worth of about $6 million despite being only 19 years old.</p><p>The following is a peek into Billie Eilish's million-dollar <a href=#>mansions</a>.</p><h2 id=the-la-house>The LA House</h2><p>Billie's LA house expands to 110 square meters. The family got this estate back in 2001 with $240,000. However, now the value of the house has increased to about $800,000 because of Eilish's legacy.</p><p><a href=#>Billie Eilish is one of the most trending pop stars</a> for generation Z, but she is also the most humble of them. Eilish has been reputed to be still residing with her parents in Los Angeles. She practically grew up listening to her favorite music icons and writing her debuts in this special place. The bedroom where she composes her music is too sentimental to her to leave behind for a fancy studio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This house might be termed as "ordinary" to the elite, but it is laden with too many memories for the rising pop star to abandon. She comes from a family of musicians. Her mother is a singer and voice artist; her father is also a singer, and her favorite is her sibling, Finneas O'Connell, who is a singer and music composer. Finneas helped Billie compose most of her hits in his small studio adjacent to Billie's own room.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Billie Eilish Net Worth (& 10 Things She Spends Her Money On)</a></span></p><h2 id=a-house-tour-with-james-corden>A House Tour With James Corden</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Billie offered a tour of her LA house to comedian, James Corden and it got broadcasted on The Late Late Show By James Corden. Corden usually receives a lot of these tours from famous faces. But Billie's house tour was one of a kind. He got to experience the artistic ambiance of the property with its own mini studio.</p><p>The star's LA property location was once revealed anonymously on the internet, and fans started flocking at her LA house. As much as Billie loves her fans, she did not appreciate this <a href=#>breach of privacy</a>. One of the main reasons she did not want to move from this property was the combination of privacy and comfort she received under her house's roof.</p><h2 id=the-spanish-colonial-mansion>The Spanish Colonial Mansion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Finneas O'Connell, Billie's brother, purchased a Spanish colonial mansion in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. Given the close relationship between the siblings, Billie is expected to move to this mansion soon. Finneas already shares the residence with his girlfriend, Lucy, but that should not be a problem for Billie as she is also known to be quite close with Lucy. They also have a pet dog named Peaches, who lives in that mansion.</p><p>Billie's brother purchased the property for about $2.73 million, and it comes with <a href=#>a hoard of luxury amenities</a>. Finneas and Lucy are known to stay in one of the master suites in the mansion, but there are several vacant suites for Bille to occupy. This estate takes about 2,600 square feet of space and has four master bedrooms along with four bathrooms.</p><p>The house might be 95-years-old, but it was renovated right before Finneas purchased it. This mansion's color is mostly white, but the owner loves his sister too much to make it overly bleak, given her taste. Thus, the entrance door is a pop red in the shade. The feeling of opulence comes from the floors made of oak wood and windows made of stained glass.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is a massive fireplace in one of the living spaces, and the entirety of the mansion creates a suitable ground for giving birth to masterpieces of music. It has a fancy studio and is thus, very tempting for Billie to move here or at least visit frequently.</p><p>Eilish has been living an extraordinary life and has often told the press that she never attended school or grew up around other kids. Her constant companion has been her brother, since they grew up together in the LA house prior to producing one masterpiece after another. Rumors are already floating around that Eilish is going to release a new album with her brother now that she is poised to move to his million-dollar mansion. Only time will tell the answer to that one.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Joe Roganâ€™s $14 Million Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woah Celebs</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yaay</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Luxury</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Gio6WhlWKyqrjIrJ9mpZGjwKq7zWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbillie-eilish-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbillie-eilish-mansion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbillie-eilish-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbillie-eilish-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbillie-eilish-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbillie-eilish-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./janet-mcteer-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./janet-mcteer-biography.html>Janet McTeer Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./health-update-on-ruby-franke-does-she-look-pregnant-details-of-her-illness.html>Health Update On Ruby Franke | Does She Look Pregnant? | Details Of Her Illness</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./health-update-on-ruby-franke-does-she-look-pregnant-details-of-her-illness.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
