Neither of them has publicly confirmed if they were a couple, but they have been seen together on several occasions and they certainly look comfortable enough to pass as a couple.&nbsp;Danny revealed that nothing really happened that night.&nbsp;Kelly invited Danny back to her place after the club.</span></p><p><span>When Danny met Kelly’s father, he didn’t seem impressed.&nbsp;Danny said he left the house as soon as Kelly’s dad went back to bed.&nbsp;Since then, Kelly has never contacted Danny again.&nbsp;Kelly got engaged again to Luke Worrall.&nbsp;Luke is a British model.&nbsp;The couple dated for a few months in 2008. They got engaged in November 2008. She wasn’t rich to marry Like.</span></p><p><span>So she decided to take her time with the planning process.&nbsp;Kelly called off the engagement after rumors surfaced of Luke cheating on her with model Elle Schneider in 2010. Kelly reportedly dated Josh Hansen for five seconds.&nbsp;Kelly was spotted at a restaurant with motocross racer Josh Hansen just a month after ending her relationship with Luke.&nbsp;The duo drove off together in the same car and this led to romance rumors.</span></p><p><span>However, neither of them has confirmed that they are dating.&nbsp;They have been reported to be spending a lot more time together.&nbsp;Josh’s ex, Stephanie Pratt, who is also a good friend of Kelly’s) was not happy to heat up these rumors.&nbsp;Kelly and Josh’s rumored romance ended as quickly as it began.&nbsp;Not enough of all that personal, Kelly reportedly had affairs with Rob Damiani and Quincy Combs in 2011. It’s unclear how long those romances lasted, but tabloids reported that Kelly was dating not one, but two guys.</span></p><p><span>She started dating her close friend, Anton Lombardi, in 2011. Anton is a photographer.&nbsp;She was seen holding hands with the photographer in May.&nbsp;Although their budding relationship definitely looked promising, it unfortunately ended quite quickly.&nbsp;Kelly got engaged to Matthew Mosshart.&nbsp;Matthew is a chef by profession.&nbsp;The couple first met at Kate Moss’ wedding in 2011. They immediately hit it off.&nbsp;They got engaged after a period of two years.&nbsp;But in 2014, the two decided to quit.</span></p><p><span>Kelly said it was a mutual decision.&nbsp;She added that, despite the breakup, they remained “really good friends.&nbsp;In 2014, Kelly started dating Ricky Hall.&nbsp;News of this new romance broke six months after Kelly and Matthew announced their split.&nbsp;Kelly moved on to dating Kes Glozier in 2016. Kes the editor of The New British magazine.&nbsp;The couple met through mutual friends and they started dating after a few months of knowing each other.</span></p><p><span>However, it was never announced when this relationship ended.&nbsp;Considering how they simply stopped dating, it’s safe to say they quietly called things off.&nbsp;Kelly moved on and dated Jimmy Q for four months.&nbsp;Jimmy is a model.&nbsp;The duo started dating in early 2019. They have been spotted at several events together.&nbsp;Unfortunately, that romance didn’t last. Elly and Jimmy initially seemed to be really well suited and were incredibly smitten.</span></p><p><span>For now, it’s safe enough to say that the singer is in no rush to embark on another relationship because now she wants to focus on herself.</span></p><h2><span>DEAR KELLY OSBOURNE</span></h2><p><span>Following her professional career as an actress, model, singer, and fashion
