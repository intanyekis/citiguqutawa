The beautiful couple just celebrated their anniversary and made sure the world knew about it.</p><p class=Zg>They took to social media to share the event with their fans and said how much they loved one another. Trisha shared two posts to commemorate the day, one on Instagram and one on Twitter.</p><p class=Zg>On Twitter, Trisha posted a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/trishayearwood/status/1601687745079844864>photo</a> of the couple nestled close together and mentioned that it was their 17th wedding anniversary. She shared a photo of them smiling at the camera on Instagram, saying the occasion called for a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Clu4UicuaEU/?hl=en">formal dress</a>.</p><p class=Zg>The Instagram post was made a week before they celebrated their anniversary, and they were both dressed formally, with Garth in a suit and <a class="zd d" href=#>Trisha</a> in a floor-length gown with an attached cape.</p><p class=Zg>Since they married in the early 2000s, Garth and Trisha have become a superstar pair who have enjoyed enormous success in the country music industry. They have also had great success in their romantic relationship.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>How Did The Couple Meet?</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>While the pair married in the early 2000s, their first meeting dates back to 1987 when they worked in the same recording studio. They were both married to their first spouses at the time, but <a class="zd d" href=#>Garth</a> knew he had met his future wife.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Trisha Yearwood and Robert Reynolds during 28th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards at California Universal Amphitheatre in Universal City, CA, United States | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>By the 1990s, the pair were both still married to their first spouses but had built a beautiful friendship and knew everything about one another. Garth said he knew when he met Trisha that he had met his wife, despite being married for 13 years already. Trisha <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood-relationship-timeline-details/>said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"Because we were each married before and we've been friends a long time, you might know some things you might not tell somebody you're dating, so it's a blessing and a curse — he knows everything about me."</p><p class=Zg>It was 2000 when Garth retired from music to spend more time with his then-wife, Sandy, and three daughters. However, he soon divorced his first wife. At the time, Trisha had divorced her first husband and married her second husband, Robert Reynolds.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Garth Brooks with his wife Sandy Mahl in the press room of the 34th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, held at the Universal Ampitheater in Los Angeles, California, 5th May 1999 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Later, Trisha also divorced her second husband. By 2002, Trisha and Garth made their first public appearance at the 33rd Annual Songwriter's Hall of Fame Awards Induction, held in New York City.</p><p class=Zg>Three years later, in 2005, Garth and Trisha became engaged. People worldwide envied their romance. By December 2005, the couple had officially tied the knot and have been happily married ever since.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>How Did Trisha Support Garth in One of His Darkest Moments?</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>After announcing that he was retiring from music in 2000, <a class="zd d" href=#>Garth</a> lived with his daughters full-time. At the time, the girls were eight, six, and four years old, and he said he learned all about girls very quickly by living with "three strange women."</p><p class=Zg>It was not an easy time for him, and he said he struggled to cope with his new life. After he and his first wife divorced, it was even more difficult. However, he said he found light at the end of the tunnel with Trisha.</p><p class=Zg>He admitted that when Trisha came into his life as a romantic partner, it felt like he had a best friend who could help him through everything he was struggling with. Trisha did so happily because, as she has <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood-relationship-timeline-details/>confessed</a>, she is "madly in love" with Garth.</p><p class=Zg>Talking about how she felt about her relationship with her two ex-husbands and the relationship she shares with Garth, Trisha <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood-relationship-timeline-details/>gushed</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"Now I understand why other stuff didn't work because this is what was meant to be.
